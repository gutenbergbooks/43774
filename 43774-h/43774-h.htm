<p><i>The work is merely a volume of details, and if it should be

which, if deemed worthy, may hereafter be analyzed by men of

events of youthful military exertions, the author, perhaps, has
the most just and well-founded ground for a hope that it may
receive the solicited approbation of your honorable institution.</i></p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p><i>To the Public</i>:</p>

<p>Books of travels, journals, and voyages have become
so numerous, and are so frequently impositions on the
public, that the writer of the following sheets feels
under an obligation to explain, in some measure, the
original circumstances that led to the production of this
volume. Soon after the purchase of Louisiana by an enlightened
administration, measures were taken to explore
the then unknown wilds of our western country&mdash;measures
founded on principles of scientific pursuits, combined with
a view of entering into a chain of philanthropic arrangements
for ameliorating the condition of the Indians who
inhabit those vast plains and deserts. His Excellency,
Meriwether Lewis, then a captain of the first regiment of
infantry, was selected by the President of the United States,
in conjunction with Captain C. Clarke [Wm. Clark], to
explore the then unknown sources of the Missouri, and I
was chosen to trace the Mississippi to its source, with the
objects in view contemplated by my instructions; to which
I conceived my duty as a soldier should induce me to add
an investigation into the views of the British traders in that
quarter as to trade, and an inquiry into the limits of the
territories of the United States and Great Britain. As a
man of humanity and feeling, I made use of the name of
my government to stop the savage warfare which had for
ages been carried on by two of the most powerful nations
of aborigines in North America. Why I did not execute
the power vested in me by the laws of the country, to ruin
the British traders and enrich myself, by seizing on the
immense property of the North West Company, which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_II" id="Page_II">ii</a></span>
found in the acknowledged boundary of the United States,
will be explained by my letter to Hugh M'Gillis, Esq., to
whom I own eternal gratitude for his polite and hospitable
treatment of myself and party.</p>

<p>In the execution of this voyage I had no gentleman to
aid me, and I literally performed the duties (as far as my
limited abilities permitted) of astronomer, surveyor, commanding
officer, clerk, spy, guide, and hunter; frequently
preceding the party for miles in order to reconnoiter, and
returning in the evening, hungry and fatigued, to sit down
in the open air, by firelight, to copy the notes and plot the
courses of the day.</p>

<p>On my return from the Mississippi voyage, preparations
were making for a second, which was to be conducted by
another gentleman of the army; but General Wilkinson
solicited as a favor that which he had a right to command,
viz., that I would agree to take charge of the expedition.
The late dangers and hardships I had undergone, together
with the idea of again leaving my family in a strange
country, distant from their connections, made me hesitate;
but the ambition of a soldier, and the spirit of enterprise
which was inherent in my breast, induced me to agree to
his proposition. The great objects in view by this expedition,
as I conceived in addition to my instructions, were to
attach the Indians to our government, and to acquire such
geographical knowledge of the southwestern boundary of
Louisiana as to enable our government to enter into a
definitive arrangement for a line of demarkation between
that territory and North Mexico.</p>

<p>In this expedition I had the assistance of Lieutenant
James [D.] Wilkinson, and also of Dr. John H. Robinson, a
young gentleman of science and enterprise, who volunteered
his services. I also was fitted out with a complete set of
astronomical and mathematical instruments, which enabled
me to ascertain the geographical situation of various places
to a degree of exactitude that would have been extremely
gratifying to all lovers of science, had I not been so unfortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_III" id="Page_III">iii</a></span>
as to lose the greater part of my papers by the
seizure of the Spanish government.</p>

<p>With respect to the great acquisitions which might have
been made to the sciences of botany and zoÃ¶logy, I can only
observe that neither my education nor taste led me to the
pursuit; and if they had, my mind was too much engrossed
in making arrangements for our subsistence and safety to
give time to scrutinize the productions of the countries over
which we traveled, with the eye of a LinnÃ¦us or Buffon;
yet Dr. Robinson did make some observations on those
subjects, which he has not yet communicated. With respect
to the Spanish part, it has been suggested to me by some
respected friends that the picture I drew of the manners,
morals, etc., of individuals generally of New Spain, if a
good likeness, was certainly not making a proper return
for the hospitality and kindness with which those people
honored me. Those reasons have induced me to omit
many transactions, and draw a veil over various habits and
customs which might appear in an unfavorable point of
view, at the same time that I have dwelt with delight on
their virtues.</p>

<p>There have not been wanting persons of various ranks who
have endeavored to infuse the idea into the minds of the public
that the last voyage was undertaken through some sinister
designs of General Wilkinson; and although this report has
been amply refuted by two letters from the Secretary of
War, published with this work, yet I cannot forbear, in this
public manner, declaring the insinuation to be a groundless
calumny, arising from the envenomed breasts of persons
who, through enmity to the general, would, in attempting
his ruin, hurl destruction on all those who, either through
their official stations or habits of friendship, ever had any
connection with that gentleman.</p>

<p>As a military man&mdash;as a soldier from the time I was able
to bear arms&mdash;it cannot be expected that a production of
my pen can stand the test of criticism; and I hope, by this
candid appeal to the justice and indulgence of the learned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IV" id="Page_IV">iv</a></span>
to induce them to spare their censure if they cannot award
their praise.</p>

<p>The gentleman who prints this work knows under what
a variety of disadvantages it has gone to the press.<a name="FNanchor_OP-1" id="FNanchor_OP-1" href="#Footnote_OP-1" class="fnanchor">[OP-1]</a> At a
distance during its publication, and engaged in my professional
duties, it was impossible to give to it that attention
which, in order to reach its proper degree of correctness,
such a work necessarily would require.</p>

<h2>PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION.</h2>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>Pike's expeditions were the first military and the
second governmental explorations which were pushed
to any considerable extent in our then newly acquired territory
of Louisiana. The name and fame of the brilliant
young soldier who impersonated the authority of the United
States over all the ground between British and Spanish
possessions are thus inseparably linked with those of Lewis
and Clark in the beginning of our history of the Great West&mdash;a
West so great that it reached from the Mississippi to
the Pacific. The two movements were similar in scope and
plan; both were in the nature of claiming possession of
property; they were alike fruitful of permanent good results;
but they differed entirely in the circumstances under
which each was devised, and to a marked degree in their
respective purposes. Lewis and Clark's enterprise originated
with the President of the United States; and though
both of the men to whom that most memorable exploration
was confided were officers of the regular army, their military
organization was entirely subservient to affairs of state,
being simply designed to secure the most efficient discipline
in the discharge of certain civilian duties. Jefferson had
invested heavily in real estate; the Louisiana purchase had
been made with the people's money; he naturally wished
to know what sort of a bargain he had made with Napoleon;
so he sent Lewis and Clark to explore the vast extent of
country he had bought. While their faces were still fixed
on the setting sun, which for them still dipped behind the
shining snow-caps, Pike set forth on his first journey northward;
while they were homeward bound from the South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VI" id="Page_VI">vi</a></span>
Sea by way of the mighty Missouri and the rugged Roche
Jaune, he was pressing on his second way toward the Mexican
mountains. Both his expeditions originated with the
commander-in-chief of the army; both were as strictly military
in method as in purpose. Pike was the simon-pure and
simple soldier, who had been ordered by his general to
carry our flag among British traders and Sioux, Ojibways,
and other Indians of the Northwest, in the first instance;
in the second place, to display that emblem of authority
among the Osages, Pawnees, and Comanches, and plant that
standard of the republic on the still disputed boundary of
New Spain in the Southwest. All else that he accomplished
was incidental to Wilkinson's main aim. How daring were
Pike's exploits, these volumes testify. Their moral effect
was enormous; their results proved far-reaching; and some
of these are still in evidence of intrepid adventure pushed
to successful issue.</p>

<p>If the record of Pike's expeditions be overshadowed by
the history of still greater and partly prior achievement, we
may remember that its luster is dimmed only in comparison
with the incomparable story of Lewis and Clark. If this
witness of arduous duty ardently done in the service of his
country stand dumb before that startling tragedy which set
the seal of sacrifice upon a devoted life, we may reflect that
such a consummation of noble aspirations but capped the
climax of unswerving patriotism and unwavering fidelity to
lofty ideals when it transfigured the already celebrated
explorer into a national hero and a popular idol. Pike's
personality is not less picturesque than is his career unique;
our interest in his character becomes vivid as we study its
manifestations, and perhaps even outgrows that regard we
may bestow upon those of his achievements which have
passed into permanent history. The present volumes tell
his own story, in his own way; they are autobiographical in
all that relates to the principal incidents and most stirring
scenes of his life, before that final catastrophe which turned
the tide of international warfare. If the narrative never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">vii</a></span>
halted at the point of an unaccustomed pen it would not be
Pike's, and it would lack a certain quality which not even a
Biddle could impart to the more polished and finished history
of Lewis and Clark. It now seems probable that both
books will endure, side by side, so long as any interest in
the beginnings of our Great West finds a place in the hearts
of the people.</p>

<p>Pike anticipated Lewis and Clark by about four years in
bringing the results of his partly simultaneous explorations
before the public. Since the first appearance of his work,
there has never been a time when it has not been cited by
scholars as an original authority in the many matters of
historical, geographical, ethnological, and related interests
of which it treats. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that Pike
has never been so widely or so well known as he deserves
to be in his double character of traveler and author. The
soldier could hardly desire greater fame than fell to the
happy lot of the hero of York, victorious in death; but
what of his life? Who was this General Pike before that?
Who was Lieutenant or Captain Pike&mdash;where did he go
exploring&mdash;what did he discover&mdash;how should we know?
In searching contemporaneous records of the War of 1812
for biographical data in the preparation of the Memoir
which introduces these volumes, it was always the great
soldier&mdash;General Pike&mdash;whom I found, with scant recognition,
if anything more than mere mention, of the still greater
explorer&mdash;the youthful, the dashing and winning, the ardent
and enthusiastic lieutenant, who dreamed of glory till his
dream came true. The fact would seem to be that Pike's
death on the field of battle, under exceptionally thrilling
circumstances, obscured rather than accentuated those
earlier exploits which set his title to fame in the clearest
and truest light. Probably no good general would have
failed in what Pike accomplished on the day of his death;
but how many subalterns in their twenties have won imperishable
renown by achievements in the field of exploration?
One purpose I had in view in preparing a new edition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">viii</a></span>
of this work will have been subserved if I have succeeded in
eliminating a certain popular aberration, in calculating aright
the parallax of Pike as viewed from different standpoints,
and in thus placing his name in proper historical perspective.</p>

<p>Nearly or quite all that an editor might be expected to
say in his preface concerning the subject-matter of his author
will be found to have been said already in one place or
another in the course of the extensive and minute commentary
which appears upon almost every page of the present
edition. Nevertheless, so few are the persons who have any
clear or coherent ideas on the subject of Pike's performances,
that it will be to consult the convenience of most readers
who may take up this book to give here a brief statement of
his journeyings.</p>

<p>Pike conducted two entirely separate and distinct expeditions.
One of them, in 1805-6, was from St. Louis by way
of the Mississippi to the headwaters of this river, and
return&mdash;for the most part by the same way he went. This
round trip, which I have called the "Mississippi Voyage,"
forms Pt. 1 of his book. The other expedition was taken
westward from St. Louis into the interior parts of the then
Louisiana, to the sources of the Arkansaw river, and among
the Rocky mountains of present Colorado. In so far as
Pike protracted this exploration of his own volition, it forms
Pt. 2 of his book, which I have designated the "Arkansaw
Journey." But at one point in the course of this journey
Pike was captured by the Spaniards, and conducted
against his will by a roundabout way through Mexico to
the then Spanish-American boundary between Texas and
Louisiana. This episode, unflattering to Pike's sensibilities,
if not wholly unforeseen by him, he saw fit to make the
subject of Pt. 3 of his book; I have entitled it the
"Mexican Tour."</p>

<p>I. In July, 1805, Pike was ordered by General Wilkinson
to explore and report upon the Mississippi river from St.
Louis to its source, select sites for military posts, treat with
the Indians, make peace if possible between the Sioux and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">ix</a></span>
Ojibways, and find out what he could about the British
traders who still occupied posts in our newly acquired territory.
Excepting these establishments of the Northwest
Company, there were then no white settlements on or near
the river beyond the village of Prairie du Chien, and our
flag had never flown in that quarter. Pike navigated his
boats to the vicinity of present Little Falls, but could get
them no further. He there built a stockade, in which some
of his men were left for the winter, and with the rest
pushed on by land along the river to Lower Red Cedar
Lake&mdash;Sandy lake&mdash;Grand rapids and Pokegama falls&mdash;mouth
of Leech Lake river&mdash;up the latter to Leech lake&mdash;and
thence to Upper Red Cedar (now Cass) lake, at the
mouth of Turtle river. This was the furthest point he
reached. He considered the Leech Lake drainage-area&mdash;which
I have called the Pikean source&mdash;to be the true
origin of the Mississippi, and remained in ignorance of the
fact that this river flowed into Cass lake from such lakes as
Bemidji and Itasca, though these and others were already
known to some of the whites. Returning from Cass to
Leech lake, and thence, by a more direct overland route
than he had before taken, to the Mississippi in the vicinity
of Lower Red Cedar lake, he descended the river to his
stockade, picked up the men who had wintered there, and
as soon as the ice broke up started in boats for St. Louis,
which he reached in safety with all his party in April, 1806.</p>

<p>II. In July, 1806, Pike left St. Louis on his second
expedition. He ascended the Missouri to the Osage, and
the latter to the villages of the Indians of that name.
Thence he continued westward overland, entered Kansas,
and proceeded to the Pawnee village on the Republican
river, near the present Kansas-Nebraska line. Turning
southward, he reached the Arkansaw river at the present
site of Great Bend. There he dispatched his junior officer,
Lieutenant Wilkinson, with a few men, to descend the
Arkansaw, while with the rest of his company he ascended
the same river into Colorado, as far as Pueblo. From this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">x</a></span>
point he made an unsuccessful side-trip which had for its
object the ascent of the since famous peak which bears his
name, and returned to his camp at Pueblo. Thence pushing
up the Arkansaw, he was halted by the Grand caÃ±on, at
the site of present CaÃ±on City. He then made a detour to
the right, which took him up Oil creek into South Park.
He traversed this park, along the South Platte and some of
its tributaries, left it by way of Trout Creek pass, and was
thus again brought to the Arkansaw. He pushed up this
river till he viewed its sources, in the vicinity of present
Leadville, turned about, and with great difficulty descended
it to the very camp he had left at CaÃ±on City. This part
of his journey was not accomplished without much hardship,
and ended in chagrin; for he had fancied himself on
the headwaters of that Red river whose sources he had
been pointedly instructed to discover. Nothing was known
at that time, to Americans, of the origin of that great
branch of the Mississippi which was called Red river lower
down; nor was it known till years afterward that what the
Spaniards had called high up by a name equivalent to Red
river was really that main fork of the Arkansaw which is
now designated the Canadian river, whose sources are in
the mountains not far from Santa FÃ©. <i>This</i> was the river
which Pike might have found, had his search been more
fortunately directed, though neither he nor any other
American was aware of that fact at the time. Nevertheless,
he determined to carry out his orders to the letter, and
with more courage than discretion pushed southward from
his camp at CaÃ±on City to discover an elusive Red river.
He passed up that tributary of the Arkansaw which is now
called Grape creek, and thus into the Wet Mountain
valley. There the party suffered almost incredibly from
cold and hunger; some of the men were frozen and crippled
for life. But Pike managed to extricate himself and most
of his companions from their perilous situation by crossing
the Sangre de Cristo range through the Sand Hill pass
into the San Luis valley, where he found himself on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">xi</a></span>
Rio Grande del Norte. He descended this river to the Rio
Conejos, and there established himself in a stockade&mdash;in
part at least for the purpose of tarrying while he sent a
small party back for those of the men who had been left
behind, both at CaÃ±on City and in Wet Mountain valley.</p>

<p>The secret which underlay Pike's ostensible instructions
from General Wilkinson, and the mystery which is supposed
to have enshrouded his movements on this portion of
his second expedition, are fully discussed in my notes, at
various points in Pike's narrative or in my Memoir, where
the subject obtrudes. Without going into any particulars
here, it is to be said simply that Pike may have been ordered
to proceed to Santa FÃ©&mdash;or as near that capital of Spanish
New Mexico as he could go with the force at his command&mdash;without
being informed of whatever ulterior designs
the general of the army may have entertained.</p>

<p>III. Pike was captured in his stockade, with the few men
he had left about him, by Spanish dragoons, under the
orders of General Allencaster, then governor of New Mexico.
The message he received from his captors was disguised
under the form of a polite invitation to visit the
governor at Santa FÃ©. On the 27th of February, 1807, he
left his post as a prisoner in the hands of a half-hostile
foreign power, accompanied by the remnant of his men.
They were treated with great forbearance&mdash;nay, with distinguished
consideration; nevertheless, Pike was brought
to book before the authorities, and required to explain how
he had happened to invade Spanish territory with an armed
force. Governor Allencaster then ordered him to report to
General Salcedo at Chihuahua; he was accordingly escorted
by the military down the Rio Grande from Santa FÃ© to El
Paso, and thence by the usual route southward, in what was
then New Biscay, to the first named city. From this capital
he was conducted, still under guard, through a portion of
what is now the State of Durango, around by the Bolson de
Mapimi, thence northward throughout Coahuila, and so on
to San Antonio. Continuing through Texas, he was finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">xii</a></span>
delivered out of the hands of his Spanish hosts and captors,
on crossing the river which in part bounds our present
State of Louisiana; and ended his long peregrination at
Natchitoches, among his own countrymen.</p>

<p>At this point the author's narrative ends abruptly, so far
as any itinerary of his movements is concerned. We are
not even told what became of the men who did not accompany
him to Natchitoches&mdash;those who were left behind
when he started from the Rio Conejos, either at that point,
or in the Wet Mountain valley, or on the Arkansaw. It
had been understood, and was fully expected, that they
were all to follow him through Mexico under Spanish
escort. It is probable that they did so, and that all were
finally restored to the United States. But at the last word
we have on the subject from Pike himself, eight persons
were still detained in Mexico. (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_855">p. 855</a>.)</p>

<p class="p2">If the reader will now turn to <a href="#Page_XXXVI">p. xxxvi</a>, he will find
there and on some following pages an analysis of the
original edition of Pike's work, together with an exposition
of the wholly exceptional editorial difficulty of reproducing
such a complicated affair in anything like good book form.
The author, like many another gallant soldier, versed in the
arts of war, was quite innocent of literary strategy, though
capable of heading an impetuous assault upon the parts of
speech. He may have acquired an impression, by no means
confined to his own profession, that a book is made by putting
manuscript in a printing-press and stirring it about with
a composing-stick, which, like a magic wand that some kind
fairy waves in an enchanted castle, will transfigure the
homeliness of the pen into a thing of beauty and a joy forever.
Pike seems to have labored under some such delusion
in preparing his copious materials for the press, and no one
appears either to have advised him in these premises or to
have revised the proofs. The result was innumerable
errors, both of the writing and of the printing, most of which
might have been eliminated with due care.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">xiii</a></span></p>

<p>In the original edition, which has never before been
reprinted in full, or in anything like its own make-up, the
three separate itineraries above noted followed one another
consecutively, with only the interruption of certain meteorological
tables. These itineraries made about one-half of the
volume in bulk, but perhaps only about one-third of the
total <i>ems</i>. They were called "Parts," respectively enumerated
I., II., III., and were the only portions of the whole
which were printed in large type, as the main "body" of
the work. The greater remainder of the author's materials
were then thrown into the form of three Appendixes, one
for each of the three foregoing Parts, each one being necessarily
displaced from its proper connection, and all being
set in small type. The contents of these Appendixes were
miscellaneous and multifarious, but reducible in the main to
two sorts: (1) Formal retraversing of the ground gone over
in the itineraries, with reference to geography, ethnology,
commerce, military and political topics, and related matters
which came under Pike's observation; (2) Letters and other
documents upon a variety of subjects, representing what
may be regarded as the officialities of Pike's Expeditions.</p>

<p>The determination to edit Pike with the omission of
nothing whatever which the work originally contained, and
to preserve as far as seemed reasonably possible the shape
in which it came from his own hand, involved a problem
whose solution was one of no ordinary difficulty. The
division of the book into three Parts was perfectly sound,
and by all means to be preserved. The main departure
from Pike's plan that seemed to be required was simply to
bring each Appendix into direct connection with its own
Part, and set it in uniform typography, as being of equal
value and interest with the itinerary. Having made these
transpositions, I found it an easy matter to introduce chapter-heads
which should co-ordinate the whole of the contents.
Each of the three itineraries could be conveniently
divided into three chapters, covering as many stages of the
several journeys; and in like manner it was found that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">xiv</a></span>
contents of each of the three Appendixes could be naturally
grouped under a few heads, thus carrying out the plan
of chaptering the whole book. To effect this result required
no change whatever in the course of the itineraries, and in
the appendicial matters involved only some few unimportant
transpositions, mainly for the purpose of rearranging the
official correspondence in the chronological sequence of the
letters and other documents of which it consisted. But even
in this small matter I have been at the pains of pointing
out the position which each separate piece occupied in the
original edition&mdash;perhaps with needless scrupulosity. A
glance at the tables of contents of this edition will show how
well or ill the remodeling has been done.</p>

<p>The transpositions thus effected, together with the repeatedly
broken and sometimes blank pagination of the
original, made it obviously impossible to indicate in this
edition the former numeration of the pages. Otherwise, in
editing Pike's text, I have been guided by the same principles
which I applied to my recent redaction of Lewis and
Clark. I do not think that any editor may feel free to rewrite
his author. It would be an unwarrantable liberty to
sacrifice an author's individuality upon the altar of literary
style. And especially in the case of an old book&mdash;one whose
intrinsic merits survive what are "the defects of its qualities,"
and thus cause it to reappear in a new guise&mdash;is it
desirable that the reader should feel sure he is offered a
genuine text. At the same time, the essentials of genuineness
are different from its factitious ear-marks, and may be
preserved with fidelity by an editor who, nevertheless, feels
free to disregard non-essentials. Pike's is both a rare and
a curious book; yet we need not venerate its abounding misprints,
or burn the incense of admiration in the face of its
frequently solecistic grammar, or even kowtow to its peculiar
punctuation. Such things as these are assuredly among the
non-essentials of a pure text, always amenable to editorial
revision, and always open to the welcome attentions of a
friendly printer. But for the rest, as I lately said on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">xv</a></span>
similar occasion, "I have punctiliously preserved the orthography
of proper names in all their variance and eccentricity;
and wherever I have amplified any statement in the text,
or diverted the sense of a passage by a hair's breadth, square
brackets indicate the fact."</p>

<p>A few words may be expected in this connection upon
the new matter, by the introduction of which the single
volume of Pike has been extended to three volumes, thus
more than doubling the original text. I have seldom, if
ever, studied a work whose author seemed to me in so great
need of an interpreter. Pike was not always precise in his
statements of fact, and sometimes failed to convey his own
meaning with entire lucidity. Much was thus left to be supplied
by the imagination of the reader, or to be clarified by
the exercise of his critical faculties, whether or no he were
sufficiently informed in the premises to follow his author
intelligently. In subjecting the text to a scrutiny, perhaps
exceptionally close and rigid, I have desired in the first
place to inform myself of the exact significance which the
author intended his words to have, thus putting myself as
nearly as possible in his place, and always, as I trust, in full
sympathy with him, however diverse from his views any of
my own opinions may have been. Coming to such understanding
of the work in hand&mdash;one whose accomplishment
is now nearly a century old&mdash;my duty seemed to be to criticise
the subject-matter from the standpoint of to-day, however
copious might prove to be the additional information
required, or to whatever extent the resulting commentary
might be protracted. This part of my work is represented
by the notes with which the present edition has been
freighted, and which are typographically distinguished from
the main text. These notes bespeak their own variety and
perhaps comprehensiveness; but of their value or interest
it is not for me to express any opinion.</p>

<p>Aside from this main exercise of an editorial function to
the best of my ability, I have been induced to add another
to the several good memoirs of Pike which we already possessed&mdash;notably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVI" id="Page_XVI">xvi</a></span>
Whiting's and Greely's. In the preparation
of this I have been able to avail myself of much
hitherto unpublished documentary material and other
sources of information which have not before been utilized
for this purpose. Under the circumstances of its present
connection this biography could be prepared with little
regard to Pike as an explorer, for these volumes cover all
such ground; and thus I could dwell for the most part upon
other aspects of his life and character, such as those which
led up to his conspicuous adventures, and especially those
of the War of 1812 which closed with his death a career of
military honor and renown.</p>

<p>At the time when Pike first appeared in print, it was the
fashion to regard an index to a book rather as an elegant
superfluity, or a luxury of leisurely authorship, than as the
imperative obligation and absolute necessity which we now
find it to be, whenever anything else than fiction or poetry
becomes a candidate for public favor. Pike has never been
indexed before; and many who now see how lengthy is the
list of proper names of persons, places, and other things,
may for the first time become aware of the extent and
variety of information of which this author's work has proved
to be either the prolific source or the pregnant occasion.</p>

<p>All of the plates which illustrated the original edition of
Pike have been reproduced in facsimile. They consist of
a portrait of the author and six maps. To these are now
added a facsimile of an autograph letter, and a new map,
both prepared expressly for the present edition. The letter
requires no further remark than that it is believed to be
the first one ever published, and that it is also printed in its
proper connection in the text of my Memoir, with many
other hitherto unpublished documents. The new map,
which I have legended as a Historico-geographical Chart of
the Upper Mississippi River, has been compiled and drawn
under my direction by Mr. Daniel W. Cronin, a skillful
draughtsman of the U.Â S. Geological Survey, and is copyrighted
by my publisher. It is based primarily upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVII" id="Page_XVII">xvii</a></span>
Map of the Mississippi River from Lake Itasca to the Falls
of St. Anthony, compiled from surveys and reconnoissances
made under the direction of Major F. U. Farquhar and
Captain Charles J. Allen, U.Â S.Â A., and from the U.Â S.
Land Surveys, published in fifteen sheets, on the scale of
inch to mile, by the Engineer Department of the Army, in
1881. The hydrographic data from this source are supplemented
from the latest map of Minnesota published by the
U.Â S. General Land Office, from the sectional maps of
Minnesota and of the Upper Mississippi lately issued by
Jewett and Son of St. Paul, and from various other sources,
in protracting the branches of the main stream and locating
the lakes, etc., beyond the area shown on the Engineer
charts. The Jewett maps are the best ones I have seen
among those published by private enterprise; the map of
Minnesota for which a certain Chicago firm is responsible
is the worst of all those which have appeared of late years.
My corner-map of the Infant Mississippi or "Cradled
Hercules," on a much larger scale than the rest, is reduced
from Brower's map of the Itasca State Park, with the
author's kind permission; the names given to the numerous
features of the Itascan source of the Mississippi are those
now officially recognized, with the addition of a few which
I have myself bestowed in the course of my notes on Pike,
among other results of my recent tour of observation. In
lettering the main part of this chart, my idea was, first, to
illustrate Pike, by marking his camps with their dates, along
the river, and also his trail, where he went overland; it is
believed that this has been done with all the accuracy that
a map of this scale permits, except for the route from Leech
lake back to the Mississippi, which has never been&mdash;and
probably never will be&mdash;ascertained with all desirable exactitude.
Secondly, I intended to give the actual present
names of all the natural and artificial features which are
delineated; and thirdly, to add to these designations all the
synonymy and other historical data which the map could
conveniently carry. Though there is theoretically no end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XVIIb" id="Page_XVIIb">xvii*</a></span>
to the information of this kind which might be put upon a
map, the practical limitations in any given case are obvious;
and overcrowded lettering would be rather confusing than
helpful to the reader. In general, the historical data which
have been selected to be legended are in direct connection
with and support of Pike's text and of my commentary
thereupon. Only those who have long experienced
the practical difficulty of making a good printer or
draughtsman misspell words in order to reproduce historical
forms literally can appreciate the obstacles to complete success
in such an undertaking; but I indulge the hope that
this chart, whatever its imperfections may be, will be found
useful enough to warrant the great pains which have been
taken to approximate accuracy.</p>

<p>As in editing Lewis and Clark, so in working upon Pike,
I have been encouraged and assisted by many friends, not
all of whom have I the pleasure of knowing personally. I
am under special obligations to Mr. Alfred J. Hill of St.
Paul, Minn., whose knowledge of the history and geography
of the Upper Mississippi region is not less accurate than
extensive. Mr. Hill has been good enough to accompany
me throughout Pt. 1 of the work, and give me the benefit
of his close scrutiny of the press-proofs, in the form of
constant suggestion and criticism, besides frequent references
to other available sources of information which I
might have overlooked. His valued co-operation to this
extent increases very appreciably the confidence which the
reader may feel in all that relates to the Mississippi Voyage.<a name="FNanchor_NP-1" id="FNanchor_NP-1" href="#Footnote_NP-1" class="fnanchor">[NP-1]</a>
Mr. R. I. Holcombe, county historian of Missouri, now of
the U.Â S. Marshal's office in St. Paul, has criticised those
pages of Pt. 2 which relate to the Osage river. The
same friendly attentions have been bestowed upon the
whole of Pike's route in Colorado by Mr. Wm. M. Maguire
of Denver; and upon various points concerning the pueblos
of New Mexico and Arizona, by Mr. F. W. Hodge of the

will be found exceptionally accurate. Mr. Robert M.
Trulan and Mr. H. E. Gore-Kelly of the Mershon Printing
Company, Rahway, N. J., have read the proofs with untiring
zeal as well as professional skill. Mr. Francis P. Harper has
set no limit to the extent to which my editorial work might
be protracted, leaving the substance of these volumes
entirely to my discretion; and I have returned the compliment
by deferring to his judgment in all that relates to
the manufacture of a book which may be found worthy to
stand by the side of Lewis and Clark.</p>

<h2>MEMOIR OF<br />
<br />
<span class="b12">ZEBULON MONTGOMERY PIKE.</span><br />
<br />
<span class="s08">BY ELLIOTT COUES.</span></h2>

<hr class="l15" />
<p>The best Life of Pike we have had is that which was
prepared by Henry Whiting and published in 1845 in
Jared Sparks' Library of American Biography, vol. xv. (or
new series vol. v.), pp. 217-314. This excellent memoir
might be now reproduced, were it not mainly occupied with
the account of those expeditions to which these volumes
are devoted, and thus for the most part superfluous in the
present connection. It still continues to be a main source
of our information concerning the events of Pike's life
before and after those exploits of 1805-7 which immortalized
his name, and is particularly valuable in all that relates
to his closing career, as the biographer was himself a distinguished
soldier and competent military critic.<a name="FNanchor_M-1" id="FNanchor_M-1" href="#Footnote_M-1" class="fnanchor">[M-1]</a></p>

<p>But I have much new matter to offer, derived from
a thorough examination of the archives of the War Department,
which include many original and hitherto unpublished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XX" id="Page_XX">xx</a></span>
documents in Pike's case,<a name="FNanchor_M-2" id="FNanchor_M-2" href="#Footnote_M-2" class="fnanchor">[M-2]</a> from diligent search among
contemporaneous records of the war of 1812-15, and from
various other sources.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>The Pike family resided in New Jersey for several
generations. One Captain John Pike acquired his military
title in Indian warfare. Zebulon Pike, the father of Zebulon
Montgomery Pike, had been a captain in the Revolutionary
army, and had served in the levies of 1791, when he
was made a captain of infantry Mar. 5th, 1792; he was
assigned to the Third sub-Legion Sept. 4th, 1792, and to
the 3d Infantry Nov. 1st, 1796; he became major Mar. 21st,
1800, and was transferred to the 1st Infantry Apr. 1st,
1802; he was brevetted lieutenant-colonel July 10th, 1812,
and honorably discharged June 15th, 1815. He died July
27th, 1834. His son, Zebulon Montgomery, was born at
Lamberton, afterward a south part of Trenton, N. J.,
Jan. 5th, 1779.<a name="FNanchor_M-3" id="FNanchor_M-3" href="#Footnote_M-3" class="fnanchor">[M-3]</a></p>

<p>During Zebulon Montgomery's childhood his parents
removed to a place in Bucks Co., Pa., near the Delaware
river, and thence to Easton, Pa. Whiting says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXI" id="Page_XXI">xxi</a></span>
that he was remembered by some of his schoolmates
who were living in 1845, "as a boy of slender form, very
fair complexion, gentle and retiring disposition, but of resolute
spirit. Instances are mentioned in which his combative
energies were put to a test, which would reflect no
discredit upon his subsequent career." He had only a common
school education, which appears to have been as slight
in quality as it was short in duration, though he was at one
time under the tuition of a Mr. Wall, a person of local
repute in mathematics. He entered the army as a raw,
shy country youth, of the most slender acquirements in any
direction, whose main making of a man was ambition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXII" id="Page_XXII">xxii</a></span></p>

<p>The records of young Pike's earliest military service are
variant in some particulars not of much consequence. In
one of his letters, printed beyond, <a href="#Page_LXV">p. lxv</a>, he says that he
entered the army when he was 15 years old. This would
be in or about 1794, and doubtless refers to his cadetship.
According to his biographer, he entered his father's company
as a cadet, date not given; was commissioned as an
ensign of the 2d Infantry Mar. 3d, 1799; promoted to
be a first lieutenant in the same regiment Apr. 24th, 1800,
and arranged to the 1st Infantry in 1802. In Heitman's
Historical Register<a name="FNanchor_M-4" id="FNanchor_M-4" href="#Footnote_M-4" class="fnanchor">[M-4]</a> it appears that Zebulon Montgomery
Pike, of New Jersey, was first appointed from New Jersey
to be a second lieutenant of the 2d Infantry, Mar. 3d,
1799; was next promoted to be first lieutenant of the same
regiment, Nov. 1st, 1799; and then transferred to the 1st
Infantry, Apr. 1st, 1802. Whatever may have been the
facts in the discrepant cases of the earlier dates, there is no
uncertainty from April 1st, 1802, when the name and rank
became First Lieutenant Z. M. Pike, 1st Regiment of
U.Â S. Infantry. It was as such that this young officer was
first detailed for detached service in the exploration of the
Mississippi, by order of General James Wilkinson, dated
from the Commanding General's headquarters at St. Louis,
Mo., July 30th, 1805.</p>

<p>Pike had not before been distinguished from any other
meritorious and zealous subaltern, though his qualities had
already attracted favorable attention. His selection by
General Wilkinson for this duty was the beginning of all
his greatness. The letter in which the detail was made will
be found elsewhere (<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_842">vol. ii, pp. 842-844</a>). The principal
other dates of Pike's brief but brilliant military career may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIII" id="Page_XXIII">xxiii</a></span>
be conveniently given here, though in so doing I anticipate
events which will come up again in their regular order: His
promotion to a captaincy in his regiment occurred by
routine Aug. 12th, 1806, when he was voyaging up the
Osage, early in his second expedition. He became major
of the 6th Infantry May 3d, 1808, in less than a year
after his return from his tour in Mexico&mdash;a journey which
was directly continuous with his second, or Arkansaw expedition,
but one which, having been involuntarily performed,
he chose to separate formally from the other, and to
make known as his "third" expedition. He became the
lieutenant-colonel of the 4th Infantry Dec. 31st, 1809.
From Apr. 3d, 1812, to July 3d of that year, he was on duty
as deputy quartermaster-general. He became the colonel
of the 15th Infantry July 6th, 1812, and was appointed to
be brigadier-general Mar. 12th, 1813. But before this
appointment was confirmed General Pike had been killed at
the head of the troops he led to the assault on York, Upper
Canada, April 27th, 1813, aged 34 years, 3 months, 22 days.</p>

<p>I am favored by Lieutenant J. R. Williams, of the army,
with the following copy of the rough draught of a hitherto
unpublished letter from General John R. Williams of
Detroit to Major Amos Holton, giving an interesting
picture of Pike, framed in his early environment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Detroit</span>, May 20, 1845.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Major Amos Holton,
Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I have recd your esteemed favor of the 14th April last, on the interesting
subject of your contemplated publication of a Biographical memoir,
illustrative of the Character and services of the late Brigadier Genl.
Zebulon Montgomery Pike of the U.Â S. Army. The half Sheet of the
Albany Argus which you designed to accompany your letter, and which
gives an account of a night battle on the Champlain frontier, I regret to
say, has not been received.</p>

<p>The period of my acquaintance with the subject of your contemplated
memoir, is indeed distant and remote; and altho' those days are still
cherished in my recollection as the halcyon and pristine days of my
youth and vigor, Yet, I cannot but be truly sensible that many interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIV" id="Page_XXIV">xxiv</a></span>
incidents have escaped my recollection in the lapse of forty-five
years.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival at Camp Allegheny in the month of May 1800 I
became acquainted with Lieut. Zebulon Montgomery Pike of the 2d
Regt. U.Â S. Infy, he was shortly afterwards appointed Adjutant of the
Regiment, in which Capacity he served during the Years 1800 &amp; 1801.
No officer could be more attentive prompt and efficient in the execution
of the several duties of his office&mdash;nor was there any more emulous to
acquire a perfect knowledge of the Military profession, nor more zealous,
ardent and persevering in the pursuit of scientific improvement.</p>

<p>It was these qualities and disposition of mind that laid the foundation
of the subsequent Character and fame of Zebulon M. Pike and would
probably have introduced him had he lived, to the highest honors, at
least, in the military profession under the Republic.</p>

<p>I then understood that his only means of Education had been such as
could be obtained in Garrison under the eye of his father then Major
Pike at the several posts he commanded, notwithstanding these disadvantages
he was a tolerable good english scholar and wrote a good hand
when I knew him and had also acquired by his own persevering industry
a tolerably good knowledge of the french language&mdash;this I know from the
fact of having frequently corrected, at his own request, several of his
translations from Fenelon's Telemachus.</p>

<p>Pike was very gentlemanly in his deportment&mdash;manners agreeable &amp;
polished, rather reserved in general and somewhat taciturn except when
incited to conversation on some topic in which he felt interest and considered
worthy of his attention he had less levity in his character than
even many of his brother officers Senior to him in Years and Rank. His
appearance was military yet somewhat peculiar he generally leaned or
inclined his head on one side so that the tip of his Chapeau touched his
right shoulder when on parade&mdash;His Stature was about five feet eight
inches tolerably square and robust for his Age which I think must have
been Twenty Years in 1800. His Complexion was then Ruddy, eyes
blue, light hair and good features his habits were in keeping with his
character, uniformly abstemious and temperate his attention to duty
unremitted. At that period the most vexatious evil and obstacle that
attended the maintenance of discipline in the Army was the general and
extensive use of Ardent Spirits, Whiskey among the Men which was constantly
being introduced in Camp by the Men &amp; Women attached to the
service and other hangers on around the Camp&mdash;On one occasion returning
to Camp from Pittsburgh about ten o'clock in the evening Pike and
myself being desirous of detecting the Soldiers in their Clandestine
manoeuvres in the introduction of whiskey approaching the Camp
silently through the bushes and occasionally halting to listen succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXV" id="Page_XXV">xxv</a></span>
in capturing several fellows with jugs &amp; bottles of their favorite beverage,
not however without a race after them. On another occasion while
going down the Ohio river in flats&mdash;The flats always halted for the night
at some convenient place furnishing good ground &amp; conveniences for
Bivouacking for the Night a guard being mounted and Sentinels placed
at suitable points around the Camp. The Soldiers were then permitted
to Land build fires and bivouac on shore if they thought proper to do so
in preference to remaining in the flats crowded as they were&mdash;there was
about 70 men detailed for the purpose of managing Ten flats containing
the Provisions under my Charge. The Signal for embarking in the
Morning was the Reveille at day break and the General immediately
after. It being then about the 20 December the weather was Cold and
a good deal of ice drifting in the River. The men generally preferred
the Company boats where they had to labor less than in those of the
Commissariat where they had to labor constantly to keep up in the line
agreeably to the order regulating the movement of the troops. One
morning they appeared to be desirous of escaping from the Commissariat
boats to their respective Company boats in hopes of getting rid of the
duty to which they were detailed and left the boats as fast as they were
ordered to embark until Pike observing their disobedience seized and
threw several fire brans at those in the Act of leaving the boats to which
they had been detailed and called to me to assist him by which means
the men were taught a lesson which was not required to be repeated the
residue of the journey down the River.</p>

<p>This prompt and decided course on the part of Pike was not only
well timed but very important as it prevented much disorder and Confusion
which would inevitably have ensued had he taken the ordinary and
regular but slow steps to punish the Mutineers, to bring them to a sense
of duty. the moment of departure had arrived, the boats were unmoored,
and those which had precedence were already under way floating
down the rapid current of the Ohio; The Colonels boat particularly,
to whom he would have had to Report was already at some distance&mdash;The
alternative then, which he adopted as quick as lightning was not only
judicious but necessary and indispensible under the Circumstances of the
Case. It operated a Salutary and instantaneous effect upon the insubordinate
Soldiery which at once brought them to a sense of duty and
order. This circumstance in my opinion speaks volumes in favor of
Pike. The quickness and decision which characterized the transaction
furnishes an index to his character neither to be mistaken nor misunderstood.</p>

<p>After our arrival at a point equidistant between Fort Massac &amp; the
Confluence of the Ohio &amp; Mississippi Rivers, about eighteen miles below
Fort Massac the Army landed on the 5th January 1801 at a high Bluff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVI" id="Page_XXVI">xxvi</a></span>
on the right Bank of the River where they encamped cleared the ground
which was covered with heavy timber laid out an encampment after the
plan of Greenville built with log huts which was named Wilkinsonville.</p>

<p>Some time in the summer of 1801 he obtained a furlow to visit Cincinnati
as it was believed, on a matrimonial expedition at which time he was
married to his present relict Mrs. Pike.</p>

<p>During the period alluded to, the duties of the Adjutant were arduous
and unremitting&mdash;especially during the encampment on the Allegheny in
addition to guard and police duty&mdash;We had Battalion drill twice or thrice
a week and Company drill every day; and Officer drill once or twice a
week, thus you can perceive that our time was industriously appropriated
to the acquisition of military knowledge&mdash;We had also the advantage of
being drilled by officers that served under the gallant Genl. Wayne and
who composed part of his Army at the memorable and decisive Battle of
the 20th of August 1794 at the Miami Rapids&mdash;</p>

<p>Colonel John Francis Hamtramck<a name="FNanchor_M-5" id="FNanchor_M-5" href="#Footnote_M-5" class="fnanchor">[M-5]</a> of the 1st Regt U.Â S. Infy acted as
Brigadier Genl. under Genl. Wilkinson being the senior Colonel of the
U.Â S. Army&mdash;his remains now lie within a stone's throw of my Office, near
the Roman Catholic Church of St Anne&mdash;As a Memorial of affection
the principal Town above this City and within the County of Wayne
bears his name Hamtramck as he was much beloved by the inhabitants
of this Country.</p>

<p>Allow me here to make mention of the principal Officers composing
the Command at Camp Allegheny. Colo. David Strong, Commandg
2d Regt Infy, Major Moses Porter with his Co. of Artillery&mdash;Major
Turner Brigade Inspector Captains Graeton, Sedgwick, Shoemaker,
(Visscher, stationed at fort Fayette) Grey, Lukens, Claiborne&mdash;Lieuts.
Rand, Whipple, Schiras, Hook, Meriwether Lewis, Wilson&mdash;John Wilson&mdash;Z.
M. Pike, Dill&mdash;&amp; to which was added at Wilkinsonville Lieuts.
Williams, Brevoort, Hughes, Hilton Many Blue &amp; Others together with a
Battalion of the 4th Regt. under Major Butler&mdash;making in the aggregate
a force of about 1000 effective men.<a name="FNanchor_M-6" id="FNanchor_M-6" href="#Footnote_M-6" class="fnanchor">[M-6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVII" id="Page_XXVII">xxvii</a></span></p>

<p>During the summer and autumn we were visited by Genl. Wilkinson &amp;
his staff Composed of Lieuts Walbach &amp; Macomb &amp; Lieut. Colo. Williams
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXVIII" id="Page_XXVIII">xxviii</a></span>
of the Engineer Corps.<a name="FNanchor_M-7" id="FNanchor_M-7" href="#Footnote_M-7" class="fnanchor">[M-7]</a> about this period sickness among the
troops and many deaths occurred in consequence of which the Troops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXIX" id="Page_XXIX">xxix</a></span>
were removed by order of Genl. Wilkinson to Cumberland Heights<a name="FNanchor_ON-1" id="FNanchor_ON-1" href="#Footnote_ON-1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a> a
season of inactivity and a prospect unfavorable to Military life prevailing&mdash;many
Officers resigned and sought to obtain a livelihood by other
means than the profession of arms. These and other subsequent events
are matters of history and I shall therefore close these short notes by
pointing to the subsequent life and services of the lamented Zebulon M.
Pike.</p>

<p>My opportunities of acquaintance with him arose from the Circumstance
of having messed with Captain Peter Shoemaker and himself
about Eight Months without intermission we three being the only members
of the Mess.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it may not be inappropriate to remark that the period
alluded to was during a state of peace. Yet, whilst the prospect lasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXX" id="Page_XXX">xxx</a></span>
that the Troops might soon expect active service against the frontiers of
the then possessions of Spain&mdash;The Zeal, Ardor, Enterprize and ambition
of our Army could not have been surpassed; and would have sustained
a comparison with the best and most glorious days of the
Revolution, or of the late War with Britain, or the later achievements of
our Braves against the forces of Mexico.</p>

<p>You are at liberty to use these notes in such manner as will meet the
object you have in view.</p>

<p>The "matrimonial expedition" to which the foregoing
letter quaintly alludes was successful, like Pike's other
expeditions of later date and greater celebrity. The young
lieutenant was married in 1801 (day of the month not ascertained)
to Clarissa Brown, daughter of General John Brown
of Kentucky. Whiting says that the issue of this connection
was "three daughters and one son. Only one of these
children reached the maturity of life, a daughter, who married
Symmes Harrison, the son of General [William Henry]
Harrison, and became a widow, many years since, with
several children." Whiting continues with the following
statements, embodying perhaps as much as has hitherto
been published of Pike's domestic relations:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXI" id="Page_XXXI">xxxi</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Mrs. Pike withdrew to the seclusion of a family residence [at North
Bend] on the Ohio River just below Cincinnati, soon after the fall of
her gallant husband, where she has since lived. It is well recollected by
most of the officers who served on Lake Ontario in the early part of the
campaign of 1813, that he regarded her with enthusiastic sentiments,
believing her to share in all his ardent longings after distinction, and
willing to make any sacrifice for their fulfilment. No doubt it was with
a heart strengthened by such feelings, that she parted with him on the
eve of the expedition in which he fell; though she may have felt, during
her long widowhood, that the sacrifice, with all its honorable alleviations,
has been at times as much as that heart could bear.</p>

<p>There was found an interesting memorandum on one of the blank
pages of a copy of "Dodsley's Economy of Human Life,"<a name="FNanchor_M-9" id="FNanchor_M-9" href="#Footnote_M-9" class="fnanchor">[M-9]</a> which General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXII" id="Page_XXXII">xxxii</a></span>
Pike habitually carried about with him. After affectionately alluding to
his wife, and his son then living, he lays down two maxims, which he
wishes may ever be present to the mind of his child, "as he rises from
youth to manhood." "First: Preserve your honor free from blemish.
Second: Be always ready to die for your country." This son was cut off
too soon to exemplify the former in his life, or the latter in his death;
but the father, in his life and in his death, exemplified them both.</p>
</div>
<p>On seeking for information in regard to General Pike's
daughter and her children, I first wrote to ex-President
Benjamin Harrison, by whom I was favored with prompt
reply, in part as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">674 North Delaware Street</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap i2">Indianapolis, Ind.</span>, May 24, 1894.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have your letter of May 21st. My uncle, Symmes Harrison, married
the daughter of General Pike and left several children; but I do not
think I know of but one who survives&mdash;William Henry Harrison, who
lives in the neighborhood of the old Pike homestead on the Ohio River,
about two and a half miles below my grandfather's old home at North
Bend.... I cannot give you the names of General Pike's children; I was
too young to have any knowledge of them. Possibly my eldest sister,
Mrs. Bettie H. Eaton, who is now residing at El Paso, Texas, may be
able to give you some information about the Pike family.</p>

<p class="left45">
Very truly yours,<br />
<span class="i2">[Signed] <span class="smcap">Benjamin Harrison</span>.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Bettie Harrison Eaton was kind enough to reply to
my further inquiries, in a letter dated El Paso, Tex., July
2d, 1894, from which I quote in substance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
My cousin's, William Henry Harrison's, mother was a daughter of
General Pike, whose maiden name was Clarissa Harlowe Pike. She
was married to my uncle, John Cleves Symmes Harrison, but in what
year I do not know. Indeed, I know very little about the Pike family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXIII" id="Page_XXXIII">xxxiii</a></span>
as I always understood that my aunt was General Pike's only child; if
he had others I never heard of them. I remember her very slightly, as I
was quite a little girl when she died. Her mother, Mrs. General Pike,
of whom I have a better memory, was a tall, dignified, rather austere
looking woman, who always dressed in deep black, wearing always a
large black Canton crape shawl and a black crape turban on her head,
which to my childish eyes gave her a somewhat awe-inspiring appearance.
She was a highly educated and accomplished woman, and a fine French
scholar. She kept for many years a diary, which was written in French.
My cousin, to whom I refer you, lives on the old Pike homestead, and
could probably give you the dates you wish, as he no doubt has the
family Bible, and the old graveyard where the family are buried is on
the place.</p>
</div>

<p>On applying to William Henry Harrison of North Bend,
O., I received a brief note dated Sept. 10th, 1894, in which
the following information is given: "My house burned
some years ago, when all General Pike's private papers
were lost. He had but one child, my mother Clara. His
wife's maiden name was Clara Brown; she was the daughter
of Captain John Brown of Revolutionary fame."</p>

<p class="p2">With thus much&mdash;none too complete, but all that I have
in hand&mdash;concerning Pike's private life, we return to his
public career. The unnumbered extant notices to which
the fame that he acquired gave rise are mainly and most
naturally devoted to the consideration of the Mississippian,
Arkansan, and Mexican exploits which form the matter of
the present volumes, but which need not occupy the present
biographer, as they speak for themselves. These cover the
dates of 1805-6-7; and before taking up Pike's life in 1808,
we may next consider the bibliography of the books to
which his expeditions gave rise.</p>

<p>The earliest one of these, forerunner of the regular
edition of 1810, is entitled:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">
<i>An Account | of a | Voyage | up the Mississippi River, from St. |
Louis to its source; | made under the orders of the War De- |
partment, by Lieut. Pike, of the Uni- | ted States Army, in the
Years 1805 and | 1806. Compiled from Mr. Pike's Jour- | nal. |</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXIV" id="Page_XXXIV">xxxiv</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging">Pamphlet, 8vo., pp. 1-68, no date, no author, no editor, no publisher, no
printer, no place of publication; title, verso blank, pp. 1, 2; text,
pp. 3-67, with colophon ("Finis."); p. 68 being "Extract of a letter
from N. Boilvin [Nicholas Boivin] Indian agent, | to the Secretary
of War, dated St. Louis, | Oct, 6, 1806. |"</p>
</div>

<p>This is an extremely rare tract. I have handled two
copies, one of which I own, title page gone; the other
being a perfect example in the Library of Congress at
Washington. There is a third in the Ridgway Library of
Philadelphia; and Sabin's Bibl. Amer. cites a fourth, in the
library of the American Antiquarian Society at Worcester,
Mass. These are all that I know of, though of course
others exist. The authorship and circumstances of publication
remain unknown, to me at least. Sabin gives the
date 1807; this is probably correct, certainly true within a
year, but questionable. I adopt it, in view of its probability,
and in the absence of conclusive evidence against it,
though Whiting says 1808. But early in 1808 Pike was
already arranging for the publication of his own book,
which appeared in 1810. Pike does not even allude to this
publication, either in his own book, or in any of the manuscripts
I have seen in which the latter is mentioned. On
consultation with Mr. A. R. Spofford over the general
aspect and "make-up," no definite conclusion could be
reached by that exceptionally well-versed librarian. It
is supposed by some, not without plausibility, to have
been a government publication; but Mr. Spofford's ignorance
of the fact, if it be such, is against this supposition;
for a publication which he cannot recognize on sight
as having been issued in Washington is unlikely. The
tract looks as if it formed a part of something else; witness
the peculiar set of the title page, the conclusion of the
Pike matter on p. 67, and the appearance on p. 68 of the
Boivin letter, having no obvious connection with the rest.
However all this may really have been, there is no question
of the genuineness of this unauthenticated narrative.
Pike never penned it&mdash;he could not write so well as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXV" id="Page_XXXV">xxxv</a></span>
anonymous author of this tract did. But whoever wrote it
had Pike's original manuscript journal or note-book before
him, and followed him closely, faithfully, and accurately.
Pike's case is put in the third person by the writer, who
gives in narrative form a better account of the Mississippi
voyage than Pike's slender literary attainments enabled
him to write for himself. This "text of 1807," as I shall
call it, when I have occasion to cite it in my commentary,
is an invaluable check upon Pike's own itinerary; he cannot
have been unaware of its existence, and the friendly hand
which thus first gave to the world the best account extant
of the Mississippi voyage should not have been ignored
when Pike came to write out his notes for publication in the
princeps edition of his several expeditions, of date 1810.<a name="FNanchor_M-10" id="FNanchor_M-10" href="#Footnote_M-10" class="fnanchor">[M-10]</a></p>

<p class="p2">Immediately upon his escape from his Spanish captors
and hosts, and his return to his native land, Pike set about
writing his book. This was finished&mdash;or at any rate so far
advanced that a contract for its publication had been made&mdash;early
in 1808 (see letter of May 27th, 1808, beyond, <a href="#Page_LXI">p. lxi</a>).
The original edition of his Expeditions is as follows:</p>

<p>It has been said, "The pen is mightier than the sword."
Pike's pen proved mightier than his sword, and pistols too,
in putting bookmaking to confusion and editors to despair.
It would be hard to find a match for the disorder in which
Pike's materials were set forth in print, especially in the
several Appendixes: Even the patient printer would not let
it go without published apology. No editor has hitherto
been found expert or rash enough to reproduce anything
like the original arrangement of the "Parts," "Appendixes"
with their numerous pieces, folding "Tables," etc. The
English editor, who first undertook to bring something like
cosmos out of this chaos, created a new book by weaving as
much as he could of the matter of the Appendixes into the
main text, or into footnotes thereto, thereby greatly reducing
the bulk of the appendicial texts. But these contained
documents which proved refractory to such treatment; the
plan could not be fully carried out, for there was a residuum
which still called for an Appendix. In fact, the real bulk of
Pike's cargo is in these Appendixes; his Itineraries&mdash;the
only portions of his book which were printed in large type,
as main text&mdash;being less important, if not less interesting,
than the rest of the freight. In approaching my own editorial
labors, my intention was to adhere as closely as possible to
the arrangement of the original. This I flatter myself I
have succeeded in doing, with a few important exceptions
to which attention is pointedly directed in my notes. These
transpositions, with the introduction of chapter-heads,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXVIII" id="Page_XXXVIII">xxxviii</a></span>
and co-ordination of all of the original book in uniform
typography, have probably effected the required result.</p>

<p>In 1811 Pike's work was also published, from another
MS. copy, with many modifications, in a handsome quarto
edition, as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>This is the standard English edition, prepared under the
careful and able editorship of Dr. Thomas Rees, from a
manuscript copy transmitted to England at the time that
the original manuscript went to press in America. This
edition, and not the American of 1810, is the basis of the
French and Dutch versions, and is also the one which was
textually reprinted as the Denver edition of 1889. Dr. Rees
made Pike a much better book than the author made for
himself. The very great differences from the American
original, due to the English editor's literary skill, are modestly
set forth in the latter's Advertisement. It appears from
this that the MS. transmitted to England "was divided into
six parts, comprising the three journals which follow, and
the observations pertaining to each in a separate portion."
As the appendicial matters were received "in the desultory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XXXIX" id="Page_XXXIX">xxxix</a></span>
manner in which they were originally composed, the editor
judged it for the advantage of the work to restore them, as
nearly as he possibly could, in distinct paragraphs, to the
places they had first occupied in the journal, thus rendering
it unnecessary to lead the reader a second time over the
same ground." In other words, Dr. Rees picked the helter-skelter
Appendixes to pieces, and wove most of their contents
into the main text, as already said. The accounts of
the Indians on the Upper Mississippi, and the Observations
on New Spain, he "preserved in their original state. The
Notes and Appendixes, with some variation of arrangement,
have been printed after the manuscripts, but a few articles
have been omitted, as containing only repetitions of what
had already appeared in the body of the work. With
respect to the language and style of the Author, the Editor
felt he had a much more delicate task to perform than in
the disposal of the materials." He therefore preserved
Pike's language in substance, but corrected his grammar
freely. Dr. Rees' avowal of the trouble he had with proper
names of persons and places will surprise no one who reads
the present edition and sees with what extraordinary perversions
of Indian, French, and Spanish names both Dr.
Rees and myself had to contend. Dr. Rees speaks also of
the "ignorant and careless transcriber" of the copy which
reached him, and observes further: "It is mortifying to find
that in America, where the Author was accessible, and
might readily have elucidated any accidental obscurities in
his manuscript, the work has been printed in very nearly as
incorrect a state as it appeared in the present editor's copy.
The sheets of the American Edition reached here some time
after his own had been in the printer's hands, but its numerous
errors, discreditable certainly to the American press, left
him little to regret that they had not arrived at an earlier
period." For the rest, Dr. Rees remarks that he furnished
"some cursory notes, which are distinguished by the letter
E," and adds: "In the account of New Spain he has subjoined
the population of several places from Humboldt's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XL" id="Page_XL">xl</a></span>
recent 'Essai Politique,' in order to furnish the reader with
the means of instant comparison. It is pleasing to observe
how nearly these statements agree in the most material
instances; and the circumstance affords no slight evidence
of the general accuracy of Major Pike's information." He
is charitable enough to refrain from adding what else this
circumstance evidences. Dr. Rees' further introduction to
his main text consists of the Congressional papers, which in
the orig. ed. form a part of the App. to Pt. 3, and which
are given this prominence, apparently, to authenticate the
whole work in the eyes of the English public by these
officialities. In the copy of the Rees edition which I have
handled I find but two maps, reduced as above said.</p>

<p>This was followed in 1812 by a French version, the title
and collation of which are here given:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLI" id="Page_XLI">xli</a></span>
p. 236, with end of the main text of Pt. 3 of the orig. ed.; thence to
end of vol. various matters from the Appendixes of Pts. 2 and 3,
including Lieutenant Wilkinson's Arkansaw Report, pp. 325-363,
and a piece of padding, pp. 293-324, this last being Remarques
Additionelles sur le sol, les productions et les habitans de la
Nouvelle-Espagne, of which the editor says that "ces dÃ©tails sont
extraits en partie de l'excellente histoire d'AmÃ©rique par Winterbotham,
et de l'ouvrage de l'abbÃ© ClavigÃ©ro." These 32 pages
of padding have no business in the book; I suppose they were
wanted to balance the bulk of the two volumes. The maps of this
edition are three in number, supposed to belong in Vol. II. They
are the Mississippi and the two Arkansaw maps, prepared by
Antoine Nau, redrawn and re-engraved, with French names instead
of English ones; the size is about the same as that of the original;
the execution is rather better. The editor apologizes, Vol I., p. xiii,
for not reproducing Pike's two maps of Mexico, because he would
not venture "d'attenter Ã  la propriÃ©tÃ© de M. de Humboldt," <i>i. e.</i>,
steal Humboldt's thunder. For it seems that Humboldt thought
Pike had done so, and he had just previously so expressed himself
in a rÃ©clamation in Le Moniteur. Humboldt compliments Pike pro
formÃ¢, and proceeds to protest: "Mais les cartes du Mexique,
publiÃ©es sous son [Pike's] nom, ne sont que des rÃ©ductions de ma
grande carte de la Nouvelle-Espagne, sur laquelle le voyageur a
tracÃ© sa route de Santa-FÃ© par Cohahuila Ã  Nacodolhes
[Nacogdoches or Natchitoches]."</p>
</div>

<p>Humboldt's direct and unqualified charge of plagiarism
against Pike, which has never been answered and is probably
unanswerable, is reiterated in that one of his works
entitled: Personal Narrative of Travels to the Equinoctial
Regions of the New Continent during the Years 1799-1804.
By Alexander de Humboldt and AimÃ© Bonpland. Written
in French by Alexander de Humboldt, and translated into
English by Helen Maria Williams, Philadelphia, M. Carey,
1 vol., 8vo, Dec. 23d, 1815, on p. xxii of which we read:
"Mr. Pike displayed admirable courage in an important
undertaking for the investigation of western Louisiana; but
unprovided with instruments, and strictly watched on the
road from Santa Fe to Natchitoches, he could do nothing
towards the progress of the geography of the provincias
internas. The maps of Mexico, which are annexed to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLII" id="Page_XLII">xlii</a></span>
narrative of his journey, are reduced from my great map of
New Spain, of which I left a copy, in 1804, at the secretary
of state's office at Washington." In this connection Humboldt
also makes the same well-founded charge against
Arrowsmith, saying, p. xxi: "My general map of the kingdom
of New Spain, formed on astronomical observations,
and on the whole of the materials which existed in Mexico
in 1804, has been copied by Mr. Arrowsmith, who has appropriated
it to himself, by publishing it on a larger scale under
the title of New Map of Mexico, compiled from original
Documents, by Arrowsmith. It is very easy to recognize
this map from the number of chalcographical errors with
which it abounds," etc.</p>

<p>Of all forms of dishonesty, literary larceny is the most
futile, because the surest of detection. Plagiarism is worse
than a crime&mdash;it is a blunder. If the matter stolen is worth
stealing, the transaction is certain to be exposed, sooner or
later. The distinction between the use and misuse of the
literary labors of another is so plain and simple that it
cannot be misunderstood. It depends solely upon whether
acknowledgment be made or not. Plagiarism acknowledged
is no plagiarism&mdash;one has only to say "by your leave," to
appropriate with impunity whatever he desires. But this
instant formula is indispensable. Subsequent apology or
explanation is impossible. Humboldt took Pike red-handed;
this the present biographer deplores; but he can
neither discover nor invent a defense. Pike's senselessness
in this matter aggravates the offense. To have acknowledged
his indebtedness to Humboldt and Bonpland, and
then utilized their work to any extent he chose, would have
been shrewd policy, as well as honest conduct; for Humboldt's
was already a name to conjure with, and the hitherto
nameless young writer could not have done better for
himself than to cite such high authority in connection with
his own work.<a name="FNanchor_M-11" id="FNanchor_M-11" href="#Footnote_M-11" class="fnanchor">[M-11]</a> I have reluctantly satisfied myself that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLIII" id="Page_XLIII">xliii</a></span>
Pike's map of New Spain is no other than Humboldt's Carte
GÃ©nÃ©rale du Royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne, with Nau's
errors and some little further modification.</p>

<p>The Dutch edition of Pike, 1812-13, is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">
<i>[1812-13.]&mdash;Reize | naar | Nieuw-Mexico | en de Binnenlanden van

<p class="hanging">Two vols., 8vo. Vol. I., 1812 (notice misprint of date on title page),
pp. i-viii, 1-327. Vol. II., 1813, two prel. leaves, and pp. 1-374,
with three maps. Printed at Amsterdam by A. Breeman &amp; Co.
In Vol. I., title leaf, verso blank, pp. i, ii; Voorberigt van den
Vertaler (Translator's Preface), pp. iii-viii, dated Amsterdam, Nov.
7th, 1812; main text, pp. 1-327, of which the Mississippi voyage
runs to p. 218 inclusive, and the remainder finishes the Arkansaw
journey, these being respectively Pt. 1 and Pt. 2 of the orig. ed. In
Vol. II. a half title and a full title make each one unpaged leaf, and
the main text runs pp. 1-374, being Pt. 3 of the orig. ed. The three
maps belong in this vol.</p>
</div>

<p>The general form and style of this version are most like
those of the French translation, from which, however, the
Dutch differs in various particulars. It appears to have
been based upon the English quarto rather than upon the
original Philadelphia octavo, and to have been translated
independently therefrom, as the French also was. Both
the Dutch and the French editions follow the English one
in working the matter of the Appendixes into the main
text&mdash;in fact, <i>no</i> edition that I know of has hitherto followed
the awkward and exasperating form of Pike's own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLIV" id="Page_XLIV">xliv</a></span>
book. The anonymous Dutch translator introduces a new
preface, and a few short footnotes, not reproducing those
of the French translator; the three maps are re-engraved
from those prepared by Antoine Nau, as in the French
edition, but with lettering of the names in Dutch instead of
French.</p>

<p>The foregoing English, French, and Dutch editions were
speedily followed by a German version. This seems to be
a scarce book; I have not yet been able to find a copy.
I presume that, like the French and Dutch, it was modeled
upon the London quarto; but with what modifications, if
any, aside from translation into another language, I have
no idea.</p>

<p>The latest and best edition of Pike which has hitherto
appeared in the United States, was published in 1889, as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hanging">

208; maps of Falls of St. Anthony and of Mexico not found;
folding tables reset to page size.</p>
</div>

<p>As appears from the foregoing title and collation, this
is a faithful and complete reprint of the English quarto.
The title page is facsimiled with the camera, down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLV" id="Page_XLV">xlv</a></span>
publishers' names; the text is identical throughout, barring
such slight literal or punctual differences as are necessarily
incident to resetting type. The only noticeable change
from the London edition is that Dr. Rees' advertisement is
replaced by a new introduction, from the pen of William
M. Maguire, Esq., of Denver. This is a valuable feature;
my only regret is that so competent and conscientious an
editor as Mr. Maguire&mdash;one familiar with much of Pike's
route, and enthusiastic on the subject&mdash;did not give the work
that extended critical revision which would have forestalled
my own commentary and left me to exercise my editorial
wits in some other direction. As it is, I am indebted to
my valued correspondent in several particulars which
appear in their proper connections in the course of my
notes.</p>

<p>It is needless to cite here the multiplied notices of Pike
and of his travels or his book which appear in ordinary
biographical and encyclopedic publications. But, aside
from Whiting's Memoir, already adduced, I may notice
some special articles of more or less recent date.</p>

<p>The Pacific Railroad Reports, XI. 1855, pp. 19-22, contain
a notice of Pike's Expeditions, by the late eminent geographer,
General Gouverneur Kemble Warren. The routes
are traced correctly, except in the instance of sending Pike
over the Continental Divide to headwaters of the Colorado
of the West; for General Warren says: "It appears that
Lieutenant Pike has the honor of being the first American
explorer that reached the sources of this large river [the
Arkansaw], and the second that crossed the divide between
the waters of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans." The first
clause of this statement is correct; in the second, the writer
was misled.</p>

<p>"Mungo-Meri-Paike" is not the name of the celebrated
Ethiopian explorer who was born at Fowlshiels, in Selkirkshire,
Scotland, Sept. 20th, 1771, and became known to
fame as Mungo Park, but a phonetization of the way "Montgomery
Pike" reverberated in Spanish ears. Colonel James
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLVI" id="Page_XLVI">xlvi</a></span>
F. Meline's Two Thousand Miles on Horseback, etc., New
York, Hurd and Houghton, 1867, exploits Pike in an interesting
manner, especially in Letter xxix, pp. 234-245.
Meline's contribution to the present biography is particularly
valuable, as it gives some documentary evidence of the
Spanish view of Pike's invasion of New Mexico. Most of
this we have in Pike's book; but one of the papers which
Colonel Meline presents, both in the original Spanish and in
an English version, must find a place here; I give it in
English, from Meline's pp. 243-245.<a name="FNanchor_M-12" id="FNanchor_M-12" href="#Footnote_M-12" class="fnanchor">[M-12]</a> It is Governor

<p>The Topeka Commonwealth, a Kansan newspaper, during
the summer and autumn of 1877 published a series of articles
by Noble L. Prentis. These were afterward gathered in a
volume entitled: A Kansan Abroad, what purports to be
the second edition of which appeared in 1878, Topeka, Geo.
W. Martin, sm. 8vo, pp. 240. One of the articles in this book,
pp. 191-214, is thus described by its author, who seems to
have been something of a wag: "The sketch, Pike of Pike's
Peak, was first delivered at Topeka, February 19th, 1877,
under the patronage of the Kansas State Historical Society.
Afterward, in the cheerful month of March, the author went
around the country with his production in the form of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLVIII" id="Page_XLVIII">xlviii</a></span>
'lecture.' It was not as funny as was expected, and, as a
lecture, was not an overwhelming success. It now appears
for the first time in print; and may it find more readers
than it ever did hearers." In this wish I concur with
pleasure; for Mr. Prentis evidently had read his Pike with
interested attention, and his essay is one of the best short
biographies of our hero that I have seen. I have occasion
to cite it twice in the present memoir.</p>

<p>In his Explorers and Travellers, forming a volume of the
Men of Achievement series, New York, Charles Scribner's
Sons, 1893, Art. VI., pp. 163-193, General A. W. Greely,
Chief Signal Officer, U.Â S.Â A., who himself illuminates
achievement in exploration, has given an appreciative
sketch of Pike's career, in the main correct, though inaccurate
in certain particulars. If I here specify two of
these, it is in no spirit of detraction, but with the good
feeling that General Greely reciprocated when I called his
attention to them. It is said, p. 173, that "Pike visited
Red Lake and passed to the north, which carried him to
the drainage-basin of the Red River"; but Pike was never
out of the Mississippian watershed on that voyage, his
furthest point being Cass lake. This was formerly known
as Red Cedar lake, whence perhaps General Greely's misapprehension.
Again, it is said, p. 183, that Pike "doubtless
crossed into Middle Park [in Colorado] and saw the head-waters
of the Colorado"; but Pike went directly from
South Park back into the valley of the Arkansaw, and
never viewed a Pacific watershed. The general's summary,
p. 175, of Pike's results on the Mississippi is judicious&mdash;a
conservative estimate, colored with a generosity which
none would wish to have been withheld:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Pike had more than carried out his orders to explore the sources of
the great river, and did something more than give to the world the first
definite and detailed information as to the upper river and its tributaries.
He discovered the extent and importance of the British trade in that
country, brought the foreign traders under the license and customs regulations
of the United States, and broke up for all time their political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XLIX" id="Page_XLIX">xlix</a></span>
influence over the Indians. He did much to restrain the unlawful sale
of liquor to Indians by domestic traders, and not only inspired the
Indians with respect for Americans, but also induced them to at least
a temporary peace between themselves. He replaced a foreign flag by
the ensign of his own country, and for the first time brought into this
great territory the semblance of national authority and government.</p>

<p>Hon. Alva Adams of Pueblo, Col., delivered an address
before the students and faculty of Colorado College, Colorado
Springs, July 12th, 1894, which was published under
the title: The Louisiana Purchase and its first Explorer,
Zebulon Montgomery Pike, 8vo, pp. 23. This is a spirited
oration, befitting the occasion and inspiring to read. It is
true that Pike's book appeared in 1810, thus anticipating
by four years the publication of Lewis and Clark; but can
Governor Adams have forgotten who first explored the
Louisiana Purchase, and returned from their expedition to
the Pacific at noon of Sept. 23d, 1806? At that date
Pike was at the Pawnee village on the Republican river;
and on the 4th of October he had the news of Lewis
and Clark's return to St. Louis. His western expedition
had been in progress only since July 15th, 1806. If Governor
Adams had Pike's Mississippi voyage in mind, that
does not alter the case. Lewis and Clark started up the
Missouri May 24th, 1804; and when Pike began to navigate
the Mississippi, Aug. 9th, 1805, Lewis and Clark were on
Jefferson river, in Montana. Furthermore, Pike was preceded
in exploring Louisiana, from Missourian waters to
those of the Rio Grande, by James Pursley, who had
himself been preceded by Jean Baptiste Lalande, as we are
duly informed by Pike himself; and it is probable that
French traders reached Santa FÃ© by the same way half a
century before Pike.</p>

<p>The Annals of Iowa, 3d series, Vol. I. No. 7, Oct.,
1894, pp. 531-36, contains an article entitled: Pike's Explorations.
This is anonymous, but was written by my much
esteemed friend, Hon. Charles Aldrich, editor of the Annals
and curator of the Iowa State Historical Department at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_L" id="Page_L">l</a></span>
Des Moines. The article is clear and concise; and it traces
Pike's several journeys with absolute accuracy.</p>

<hr class="l15" />

<p>We return from this bibliographical excursus to resume
the thread of Pike's biography&mdash;would that there had been
many more years to chronicle in the gallant and patriotic,
but all too brief, life of the young soldier! No longer lieutenant,
but captain, since Aug. 12th, 1806, Pike was delivered
out of the hands of "our friends the enemy" on the Sabine
river, to which he had been escorted by his Spanish captors,
June 29th, 1807; and arrived at Natchitoches about 4 p. m.,
July 1st. The following letter was received at the War Department
Sept. 29th, 1807; it is not included in the Appendix
to Pt. 3 of the book, and has probably never been
published. I print verbatim from a copy of the original
now on file in the office of the secretary of war:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Natchitoches</span> 15 July. 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span></p>

<p>I arrived here a few days since with part of my command only, the
ballance being yet in New Spain, but expect them daily; as the Capt.
General assured me they should follow me in a short period; he detaining
them I presume, to put them through an <i>examination</i>, when he
conceived they would be more easily <i>intimidated</i> into some equivocal
expressions; which might palliate the unjustifyable conduct of the
Spanish Government with respect to the expidition which I had the honor
to command.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the sentiments of the Executive of the United States
as to the conduct of the Spaniards to <i>myself</i> and <i>command</i>, I am bound
to submit. Yet I am conscious that our Honor and Dignity, as a nation
will not permit us to tranquilly view, the violation of our Territories;
infringements of Treaties; Hostile communications to our Savages; and
oppression of our Citizens; in various Instances: all of which I can make
manifest.</p>

<p>The unreasionable Ideas of the Vice Roy, &amp; His Excelly the Capt.
Genl. (the immediate representatives of his Catholic Majesty on our
Spanish Frontiers) as it respects the line of Demarkation, is such that in
my humble oppinion almost precludes the possibility of a thought that
they can ever be amicably adjusted.</p>

<p>On that subject I flatter myself I have acquired some important and
interesting information.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LI" id="Page_LI">li</a></span></p>

<p>Although the Capt. Genl. seized on (what he conceived all) my papers,
I yet possess by a little strategem, the whole of my Journals; courses;
and distances; and many other Geographical; Historical; and Philosophical
notes; which I presume will be worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p>I conceive by a fortuitous event, that information has been acquired
of the Spanish Kingdom of New Spain, which a foreigner never yet
possessed; and which in case of a rupture between the United States,
and that Govt, will be of the highest importance: but should peace still
continue to bless those happy climes, will afford pleaseing subjects of
contemplation, for the statesmen, the philosopher; and the Soldier.</p>

<p>I received from Genl. Wilkinson, some Conditional Orders on my
Arrival at the place [this place&mdash;Natchitoches]; to which I have
replied; but as the destination of that Gentleman, was uncertain, I
thought it my duty to make a short report to you: I shall remain
here waiting for my men a short time longer (as I expect some important
information by their hands) when I shall march by the way of Kentucky,
for the City of Washington. My papers being in such a mutilated and
deranged state it will require some time to arrange them &amp; (to which
object every moment shall be devoted) likewise at Washington: I can
obtain some necessary assistance as it would take one person a great
length of time to make fair copies, and draughts of the plans, Journals
&amp;c &amp;c of a tour of upwards of 4000 Miles&mdash;</p>

<p>The Surveys of Capns Lewis &amp; Clark; mine of the Mississippi; Osage;
upper Arkensaw; L'Platte; and Kans rivers; with Lieut Wilkinson's, &amp;
Mr. Freemans, of the lower parts, of the Red, and Arkensaw rivers;
together with the notes I intend takeing on my route from hence up the
Mississippi; will I presume form a mass of matter; which will leave but
<i>three</i>, more objects, to be desired in forming a compleate chart of
Louisiana.</p>

<p>While at Natchitoches, Captain Pike made it one of his
first concerns to move in the matter of Captain Nolan's
men, then prisoners in Mexico: see beyond, pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_609">609</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_657">657</a>,

The case is little known, and has not
proved an easy one to recover. But through the kind
attentions of the eminent historian, Reuben T. Durrett,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LII" id="Page_LII">lii</a></span>
LL. D., president of the Filson Club of Louisville, Ky.,
I am put in possession of an article which appeared in the
Natchez Herald of Aug. 18th, 1807, setting forth the facts
in full. This I have the pleasure of presenting, literally
according to the type-written copy which Dr. Durrett transmits,
Apr. 12th, 1895:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">Nachitoches</span>, July 22, 1807.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>&mdash;Inclosed you have a statement of the situation of the
companions of the deceased Philip Nolan, and a short account of the
ineffectual application I made, to rescue them from the eternal slavery,
which it is to be feared, is destined for them, unless our government
should be pleased to interfere in their behalf. Certainly the court
of Spain would be too generous to refuse liberty to a few debilitated
and half-lost wretches, who have at least expiated their crime, (if any)
tenfold.</p>

<p>As I promised on my arrival in the United States, to give their friends
an account of their situation, I could conceive no more certain and
expeditious a method than through the medium of your Herald, and
therefore wish you to give this communication publicity; and hope the
Editors of the Gazettes of the states in which the friends of those
unfortunate young men may belong, will republish it, that their connections
may receive the melancholy assurances of some being in existence,
and that others are beyond the power of tyranny and oppression.</p>

<p class="p2">In a late involuntary tour which I made through part of his Catholic
majesty's dominions of New Spain, whilst at St. Affe [Santa FÃ©], the
capitol of N. Mexico and Chihuahua, I met with a number of the poor
unfortunate companions of the deceased Nolan. One of whom gave me
the following cursory statement of their treatment, &amp;c. since their being
taken, and on their joint application, I addressed a letter to his excellency
Nemeio [<i>sic</i>] Salcedo, in their favor, of which an extract is subjoined, with
the verbal reply of the general.</p>

<p>"We crossed the Mississippi on the 1st day of November, 1800, at the
Walnut hills [Nogales], and in January following arrived at the river
Brassus [Brazos], in the provinces of Texus, and proceeded to build pens
[for the capture of mustangs]. In March, 1801, we began to run wild
horses, and having caught several hundreds of them we selected the
handsomest and let the ballance go. On the 22 of March, we were
attacked at break of day, by sixty regular troops, and two hundred and
forty militia and Indians, with one field piece. Our commander, (Nolan)
being killed, we capitulated in the evening, on the assurance that Nolan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LIII" id="Page_LIII">liii</a></span>
was killed, who only was to blame, we should be conducted to Naggadoches
[Nacogdoches], from whence there was no doubt, we would
have permission to return to our country, as soon as the circumstances
were stated to the governor of St. Antonio. We remained there under
promises and daily expectations of being released until July, when we
were all put in heavy irons.</p>

<p>"In August we were marched, in irons, to St. Antonio [Texas]; and
in December through the province of Coqquella [Coahuila] and [New]
Biscay, into the vice-royalty of Mexico, to the city of St. Louis Potosi,
where we remained fourteen months, ironed, and in close confinement.
In February, 1803, we were dispatched to Chihuahua, where after some
time, our irons were struck off. From which to the present time, we
have experienced various treatment, sometimes enjoying the liberty of
the town, sometimes the barracks, and for three months in irons and
close confinement.</p>

<p>"David Fero, from near Albany, state of New York, has been alternately
in irons, the guard-house, limits of the fort or procedie [presidio]&mdash;is
now confined to the limits of a fort called Cayome [<i>sic</i>], eight
leagues distant from Chihuahua&mdash;in bad health. [See beyond, pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_660">660</a>,

<p>"Simon M'Coy, of the Oppelousas, or Natchez, a carpenter by profession,
has the liberty of the town of Chihuahua&mdash;in good health.</p>

<p>"Joseph Reed, state of Kentucky, in the province of Biscay, but in
what part and how situated unknown.</p>

<p>"Solomon Cooley [Colly of pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_609">609</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_613">613</a>, beyond], of the state of
Connecticut, a taylor by profession, carries on his business in the town
of St. Affee, which is his limits.</p>

<p>"William Danton, of Natchez, residence and situation unknown.</p>

<p>"Charles King, of Natchez, works at the carpenter's trade, is confined
by night to the quartel at Chihuahua&mdash;in good health.</p>

<p>"Ephriam Blackburn, of Natchez, is in some of the procedios of the
province of Biscay&mdash;situation unknown.</p>

<p>"Joel Pears, of North Carolina, deceased at Chihuahua.</p>

<p>"John Waters, of Winchester, Virginia, a hatter, and carries on his
business at Chihuahua, has embraced the Roman Catholic faith, after
betraying a well concerted plan of his companions to effect their escape,
and in which it is supposed they would have succeeded: his treachery
caused them a close confinement in irons, and in a loathsome prison for
three months&mdash;he is hated and despised, not only by his own countrymen
but by every honest Spaniard in the place.</p>

<p>"Ellis Bean, of Granger county, state of Tennessee, a hatter, formerly
carried on his business in the city of Chihuahua, but being detected in
an intrigue with the daughter of an officer, and refusing to marry her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LIV" id="Page_LIV">liv</a></span>
was in close confinement at St. Jeronime [San Jeronimo], a few leagues
distant, in good health.</p>

<p>"Thomas House, of Jefferson county, Tennessee, blacksmith, confined
to the quartel at night, but at that time was at the hospital, in a very bad
state of health.</p>

<p>"Stephen Richards, of Natchez, has inlisted in the Spanish service,
was lately at Baton Rouge with his father, in the quality of a citizen&mdash;belongs
to the troops at Nagadoches."</p>

<p>[Here follows the above-mentioned letter from Pike to his Excellency,
General Salcedo, given beyond, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_810">pp. 810-812</a>.]</p>

<p>This letter I presented personally, &amp; after the general had learned its
contents, through an interpreter, he observed in reply That having found
those men, on his arrival from Europe, to take the command of the
internal provinces of New Spain, in the dungeons of St. Louis Potosi, he
had demanded them of the Vice-Roy, and brought them to Chihuahua,
where their irons were struck off, and every indulgence allowed them
which his responsibility would admit&mdash;that he had felt a particular desire
to serve Fero, but whose haughtiness of soul would not permit him to
be under any obligation to the government, further than his allowance
of twenty-five cents per day. That he had reported their situation to the
King, and consequently must await the orders of his majesty; that with
respect to the letters, they had always been permitted to correspond
through him, with their friends&mdash;but that I might use my own pleasure
as to taking letters, but he thought the peculiar delicacy of my own
situation, should prevent me from taking any written communication out
of the country.</p>

<p>Thus ended the conference, and thus stands the situation of those
unfortunate men at present. But as I knew some part of the general's
information to be incorrect, and especially as it related to the freedom of
communication with their friends, I felt no such peculiar delicacy as to
prevent my bringing out letters&mdash;but brought every one intrusted to
my care.</p>

<p>The records I have examined do not show Captain Pike's
movements for the next few months. But imagination
easily forges the missing links of the return of an intrepid
and successful explorer who had been a captive in foreign
lands, given up by his friends as lost to them forever&mdash;a
loved husband, whom <i>domus et placens uxor</i> awaited&mdash;a
hero, whose story remained to be told to a public eager to
hear of El Dorado. He was in Washington soon&mdash;most
likely before the end of the year, certainly in Jan., 1808&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LV" id="Page_LV">lv</a></span>
already in hot water. For he took a header into the
political caldron, which perpetually boils there, but had
been superheated for him in consequence of his supposed
confidential relations with his military commander-in-chief.<a name="FNanchor_M-13" id="FNanchor_M-13" href="#Footnote_M-13" class="fnanchor">[M-13]</a>

His name came before Congress in a way which ruffled his

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span></p>

<p>The Honorable John Rowan of the House of representatives from
Kentucky; has this day made some observations before that Honarable
body from which a tacit inference might be drawn that my late Tour to
the Westward was founded on Views intirely unknown to the Government;
and connected with the nefarious plans of Aaron Burr and his associates.
Had those insinuations arisen in any other quarter I should have concieved
that my early choice of the military life, the many ardious and
confidential duties I have performed, with the perfect knowledge which
the Goverment must have of my military and political Character; would
have been a sufficient justification for me to have passed over them in
silence: but comeing from so respectable a source. I feel it a duty to
myself; my family; and my profession; to request of you a testimonial
which may shut the mouth of Calumny&mdash;and strike dumb the voice of
slander. I have therefore to request of you Sir! to Honor me with
a communication which may be calculated to present to the Speaker of
the House of representatives; or a Committee of their Body, who have
been appointed to inquire whether any, or what, extra Compensation

<p><span class="smcap">Sir.</span> In answer to your letter of the 22<sup>d</sup> Inst. I with pleasure observe
that alth'o the two exploring expeditions you have performed were not
previously ordered by the President of the U.Â S. there were frequent
communications on the subject of each, between Gen<sup>l</sup>. Wilkinson &amp;
this Department, of which the President of the U.Â S. was aquainted
from time to time, and it will be no more than what justice requires to
say, that your conduct in each of those expeditions met the approbation
of the President; and that the information you obtained and communicated
to the Executive in relation to the sources of the Mississippi &amp; the
natives in that quarter and the country generally as well on the uper
Mississippi as that between the Arkansas &amp; the Missouri, and on the
borders of the latter extensive river to its source, and the adjacent
countries, has been considered as highly interesting in a political,
geographical &amp; historical view. And you may rest assured that your
services are held in high estimation by the President of the U.Â S.; and if
opinion of my own can afford you any satisfaction I can very frankly
declare that I consider the public very much indebted to you for the
enterprising persevering and judicious manner in which you have
performed them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Captain Pike was panting for promotion&mdash;dear
to every soldiers heart, and in his case well deserved.
His majority was in sight but not in hand. There appears
to have been a technical obstacle in his way. We often
smile at the witticism expressed in the phrase: "the United
States and New Jersey." Like most such things, it is not
new. Being a Jerseyman, Captain Pike was required to
establish the fact that he was not an alien to the United
States&mdash;not for that reason, perhaps&mdash;still he was required
to produce certain evidence of citizenship, as the following
curious correspondence shows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">New-Jersey.</span> <span class="smcap">Trenton</span> 23<sup>d</sup> March 1808.
</p>

<p>It appears by the records of this State, that Cap<sup>t</sup>. John Pike, in the
Year 1666, was one of the Original purchasers of &amp; Settlers in Woodbridge&mdash;a
magistrate &amp; member of Council under the Proprietory government.&mdash;I
have been well acquainted with Major Zebulon Pike, from my
Childhood and with Capt. John Brown (Lieuten<sup>t</sup>. of Cavalry in the
revolutionary War) also a Native of Woodbridge&mdash;and whose daughter
Cap<sup>t</sup>. ZM. Pike married; so that Cap<sup>t</sup> Pike has good reason to claim
New-Jersey, not only as his Native State, but as the residence of his
family for near a Century &amp; a half.</p>

<p>The above certificate of Governor Bloomfield was inclosed
by Pike to the War Department with the following
letter:</p>

have conceived it necessary to have laid it before you had I not understood

<p>Having thus proven that he was a citizen of New Jersey
and of the United States, the captain could feel that the

the 6th Infantry, of date May 3d, 1808, was acknowledged
by him in the following letter, which I have also chosen as

<p>Among other things which had engaged Major Pike's
attention was of course his book&mdash;that story of his adventures
which he had fondly dreamed would immortalize
his name, and respecting which his dream was realized.
He had already made such progress in his literary work
that he entered into official correspondence with the
Secretary of War on that subject. For instance:</p>

<p>Matters thus being satisfactorily arranged for the publication

of his book, Major Pike seems to have returned at
once, or very soon, to military duty in his new rank&mdash;unless
he went to see his wife on leave of absence. We find him
at Belle Fontaine in August of this year, as evidenced by a
letter I will transcribe in part, epitomizing the rest:</p>

<p>Before the year closed Major Pike had come East, and
found his hands full, no doubt, in presenting to Congress
the claims of himself and his men to the generous consideration
of that body, in the little matter of an appropriation
for their benefit. Those who have ever had occasion
to cool their heels in the halls of greatness, till the mercury
of their hopes congealed in the bulbs of their thoroughly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXIII" id="Page_LXIII">lxiii</a></span>
refrigerated boots, will best appreciate Pike's plight. The
novelist's realism of little Miss Flite in Chancery is out-realized
in the Bleak House on Capitol Hill, which William
McGarrahan haunted for a lifetime, and from which his
injured ghost may not yet be freed. The following letter
was written when Pike had not lost hope:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

Wilkinson&mdash;Inclosed you have a return of the party on each tour
and the commencement &amp; expiration, but as all the intervening time between
my return from the source of the Mississippi to our departure to
the West we were employed in prepareing for the second tour; I submit

there being a number of men still in new Spain the time will necessarily
be extended to them. [This matter makes chap. vi., pp. <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_840">840-855</a>,

<p>Nothing came of this move. Pike was less fortunate than
Lewis and Clark. The difference did not all depend upon
merit; simply, he had no political "pull." His expeditions
originated with General Wilkinson; they were military
movements with which the President had nothing to do.
Jealousy is the most nearly universal of human weaknesses,
in high as well as low places; besides which, Thomas Jefferson
had his own opinion of James Wilkinson. Whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXIV" id="Page_LXIV">lxiv</a></span>
Major Pike may have thought of it, he certainly lost little
time in dancing attendance on Congress; he was not built
for a lobbyist. In Dec., 1808, we find him on military duty
at Fort McHenry, Md., as appears from various official letters
of his before me, but which need not be transcribed, as
they represent merely the routine correspondence of an
army officer. At some period in 1809 he was transferred to
the West; and he was on duty as military agent in New
Orleans from Sept. 13th, 1809, to Mar. 10th, 1810, or later,
by virtue of the following order:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During his tour of duty in New Orleans Major Pike became
lieutenant-colonel of the 4th Infantry Dec. 31st, 1809.
One of Lieutenant-Colonel Pike's letters shows that he did
not forget "Baroney," his quondam companion in arms on
the Arkansaw:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left65"><span class="smcap">New Orleans</span><br />
<span class="i2">March 4<sup>th</sup>. 1810</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span></p>

<p>Ensign Vasquez of the 2<sup>d</sup> Infantry who was late Interpreter on the
tour of Discovery to the source of the Arkansaw &amp;<sup>c</sup> presented himself to
me at this place. After being three years in the United States service
without receiving any settlement I made a statement of his accounts and
gave him an advance in Cash and a draft for the balance, in order that
if the form of settlement did not meet your approbation they might be
corrected. He has been absent going on four years, and begs permission
to return to St Louis to see his Aged parents, which I hope will be
granted him by the Hon<sup>l</sup>. Secretary of War. The French language is
his proper one; but he speaks Spanish very well, and is beginning with
the English, but very imperfectly as yet. Under those circumstances I
should conceive his services would be most important on the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXV" id="Page_LXV">lxv</a></span>
Frontiers. As he is about to embark for the City of Washington, I shall
furnish him with a duplicate of this letter, and remain Sir, with</p>

<p>There is little to mark Lieutenant-Colonel Pike's career in
1810-11, or until the breaking out of the war of 1812.
From many letters I have seen by which he can be traced
in these years, uneventful for him, I select one which shows
the workings of his mind at this time, as well as his readiness
to ventilate the views which he entertained. Characters
such as his have visions which they may freely express
without carrying conviction to others. The following communication
was received at the War Department from
Mississippi Territory:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Cantonment, Washington</span> June 10, 10</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span></p>

<p>Although, it may be deemed unmilitary in me (a Subordinate in Command)
to address myself immediately to the War Department yet the
purport of this Communication being principally of a private nature, I
presume it will not, be deemed a great deviation from propriety.&mdash;I
entered the Army at the early age of fifteen, and have continued to
pursue my profession with enthusiasm to the present time a period
upwards of Sixteen years during which I have had every practical experience
which the times offered of becoming a Soldier.&mdash;Together with a
Careful perusal of numerous Millitary authors in the French &amp; English

by Such Judicious Measures; That the opportunity which I have so long

Occured.&mdash;Knowing that it must be the interest of the U.S to keep at
peace with the world, and despairing of ever being Call<sup>d</sup> Into actual
service I should some time since have resign<sup>d</sup> the sword and became a
farmer, (The only proffession I can acquire) only for the unsettled state
of our foreign affairs.&mdash;Fortune has at length placed me (Through the
instrumentality of General Hampton) at the Head of the Compleatest
body of Infantry in the US.&mdash;If this Regiment should be Consolidated
and the Co<sup>l</sup>. not join, I should be very happy to retain the Command and
remain in this quarter.&mdash;If not I would hope to be ordered to join my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXVI" id="Page_LXVI">lxvi</a></span>
Regiment in New England, a quarter of the Union I should be gratify<sup>d</sup>.
in spending some time in.&mdash;Should I remain here and be permitted to
introduce the modern Discipline&mdash;into the Corps I would pledge my
existance it would be equal to any in the U S. in one year. This is a
subject of much diversity of Oppinion, as many gentlemen wish to Confine
us to Stuben.<a name="FNanchor_M-15" id="FNanchor_M-15" href="#Footnote_M-15" class="fnanchor">[M-15]</a>&mdash;The value of whose system no man appreciates more

been such, as entirely to overturn the principles of manourvres of the

the United States can only be viewed as the nuclues of an Army in Case
of War, from whence Could be drawn Staff Officers well versed in tactics
and police&mdash;In the foregoing observations I mean to cast no reflections
on my superior officers;&mdash;but Conceive at the same time the Ideas may
not be deemed obtrusive On the Hon<sup>l</sup> Secty of War.&mdash;Whilst makeing
this unofficial Communication I think it my duty to intimate the situation
in which the neighbouring province of Florida now stands. The Goverment
is in a Compleat state of Lethargie.&mdash;The Citizens are forrming
committees and appear to be disposed to offer their allegiance to the U
S. when if it should be refused, they will Make it a tender to Great
Britain this would have been done some time since had they not feared
the Isle of Cuba.&mdash;That Cuba is competant to keep them in Subjection
by force is extremely doubtful; But what line of Conduct the U. S will
persue on the Occasion is an important question.&mdash;our views should only
be turned to the effect our interferance would have abroad for we have
disposible force in this territory &amp; Orleans when joined to the Malcontents
amply sufficient to secure possession of the province; But with
respect to the effect this would have on Mexico is seriously to be taken
into concideration Mexico including all the possessions of Spain North

Calvary surpass'd by none in the World. To this power We might
become the Carryers and Manifactories, for which no Nation Could vie
with us; which would be sources of immence Wealth.&mdash;And an Augmentation
of our power.&mdash;To this very important object I humby Conceive
a too early attention Cannot be paid&mdash;On this subject I have probaly
intruded my oppinion on Mr. Eustis, but I could not forbear giveing
those intimations which I conceived might be beneficial to my Country.&mdash;I
had a brother in the Millitary Academy from whom I have not heard for
some time should he merit the favour of his Country;&mdash;or if his Fathers
Thirty Years service or my own claim some small indulgence for him, I
hope he may be appointed an Ensign of Infantry and sufferd to join the
Regiment to which I may be attached; the latter part of this request is
not made from a desire that I may have it in my power to shew him any
favour;&mdash;far from it,&mdash;but that, I may have him near me to Restrain the
Disposition which all youths evince for irregularities. And point out to
him the paths of propriety and Honor, also that he may benefit [by] the
few years he can appropriate to study by the use of a variety of Millitary
Authors I have collected.&mdash;Such are my reasons for wishing my brother
with me. I hope this may meet the approbation of the Hon<sup>be</sup> Secr<sup>ty</sup>.&mdash;And
this letter may be attributed to its true motives, and that the Honble

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Pike's "despair of ever being called
into service" was of short duration. He was soon to be
called upon to lay down his life for his country on the battlefield.
From April 3d, 1812, to July 3d of that year he
had been deputy quartermaster-general. He was promoted
to the colonelcy of the 15th Infantry July 6th, 1812. The
war was upon us. Colonel Pike's qualifications for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXVIII" id="Page_LXVIII">lxviii</a></span>
command of a regiment may be best estimated in the
terms of his military biographer, General Whiting, who
says, pp. 309-311:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Probably no officer in the army, at that time, was held in higher
estimation. This was not because he had seen much actual service, for
he had hardly been in the presence of the enemy before the day on
which he fell. It was on the promise, rather than the fulfilment, that
the public mind rested his character for boldness and enterprise; and
his fitness to direct and control men had been determined, to an extent
that warranted much confidence, by his expeditions in the north-west
and the south-west. He had there given such proofs of those qualities,
as established a reputation in advance. He had exhibited, moreover, an
indefatigable activity in the drill of his regiment, requiring of all under
his command an unwearied devotion to duty, and an exact and prompt
obedience to orders.</p>

<p>His regiment became an example of zeal, discipline, and aptitude in
movements; his men had an unbounded belief in his capacity, and his
officers looked up to him with unusual respect and affection. He
inspired that confidence in all under his orders, which is almost a certain
evidence that it is merited.</p>

<p>At the opening of the war of 1812, we were almost without any
fixed guides in tactics and discipline. The standard of the latter part of
the revolution, and of subsequent times, "Old Steuben," which had been
approved by Washington, and had led to some of the best triumphs of
the closing years of that glorious period, had become obsolete, even
before any substitute was provided. Hence, when new regiments
came into service by scores in 1812, nothing was prescribed for regulation
or for drill. The old regiments had their forms and customs, which
preserved in them the aspect of regulars. But even these presented
no uniform example. Some adopted the "nineteen man&oelig;uvres" of the
English; others, the ninety-and-nine man&oelig;uvres of the French; while a
few adhered to old Dundas; and fewer still to older Steuben.</p>

<p>Nothing was laid down by the proper authority; therefore all manner
of things were taken up without any authority at all. Amid
this confusion, or wide latitude of choice, General Pike, though brought
up in the old school, was often tempted, by his ambitious desire for
improvement, to run into novelties. With a prescribed rule, he would
have been the most steady and uncompromising observer of it. But,
in such a competition for beneficial change, he most naturally believed
himself as capable as others of changing for the better.</p>

<p>In this spirit of innovation, the 15th regiment underwent many
changes, and exhibited, even in times when novelties and singularities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXIX" id="Page_LXIX">lxix</a></span>
were no rarities, perhaps the widest departure from common standards
of any regiment in service. Adopting the French system of forming in
three ranks, his third rank was armed in a manner peculiar to itself,
having short guns, being the ordinary musket cut off some inches, and
long pikes. It was said, by the wags of the day, that his own name
suggested the manner, and the regiment was often called "Pike's regiment
of pikes."</p>
</div>

<p>These pikes presented a formidable appearance on drill
and dress parade, when the men could display their tactics
with the precision of automata. They were even retained
in the assault of Fort York. But at the first engagement
after the fall of General Pike, the men threw them away,
together with the cut-off pieces, and picked up English
muskets to fight with. The experiment of putting his regiment
on snow-shoes which Pike tried&mdash;doubtless remembering
their serviceability to himself and his company on
the upper Mississippi in the winter of 1805-6&mdash;does not
seem to have proven any more lasting or decided a success.</p>

<p>Colonel Pike's sword was stronger than his pen, as we
know; but he could sharpen either weapon on occasion, as
the following spirited repulse of a newspaper attack on his
regiment will show:<a name="FNanchor_M-16" id="FNanchor_M-16" href="#Footnote_M-16" class="fnanchor">[M-16]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Camp near Plattsburg [N. Y.]</span>, <i>Oct. 12th, 1812</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>However incompatible it may be with the character and profession
of a soldier, to enter into the party politics of the day, yet when the
honor of the government, the corps he commands, and his personal
fame are wantonly attacked, and attempted to be sacrificed to satiate the
malignant venom of party purposes, it becomes his duty as a man, a
patriot, to come forward and boldly contradict the base calumniator.
The following piece "from the Connecticut Herald" and republished in
the New York Herald of October 3d, is not only calculated to bring disrepute
on the government, but to hold up our army as a mob wanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXX" id="Page_LXX">lxx</a></span>
in discipline as well as in patriotism. The piece alluded to is as
follows, viz.:</p>

<p>"The multiplied proof of folly, or of madness, or some worse cause,
that have driven the nation into a ruinous, offensive war, are accumulating
with every day's experience. Barely to enumerate the evidence
would occupy columns. Two or three facts of recent occurrence, which
have come to my knowledge, are in point and worthy of record. It is
then a fact (for I state it on the best authority) that either the national
treasury is so miserably empty, or the proper department so deficient in
duty, that the army under General Dearborn, which has so long been
idling away their time near Albany, was not only unpaid, but unprovided
with the common necessaries of a camp; and when, a few days since,
a part of these troops were ordered to the frontiers, one whole regiment
(Colonel Pike's) absolutely refused, and deliberately stacked their arms,
declaring they would not move until paid. In this refusal they were
justified by their colonel, and an old soldier, who admitted they ought
not to march unless the government would first pay the arrears due
them. It fortunately happened that Mr. Secretary Gallatin was then at
Albany, and on learning the state of affairs at the encampment, he borrowed
$20,000 from one of the banks on his private credit, by which
means the troops were paid, and cheerfully followed their commander."</p>

<p>In contradiction to this statement it will be sufficient to give the
following facts:</p>

<p>[Firstly]&mdash;That the regimental paymaster had in his hands funds to
pay the whole regiment up to the 31st. And [that] within three days of
the period when the troops moved, three companies were paid previous
to the march and the balance so soon as the troops halted a sufficient
time to give the officers an opportunity to adjust the rolls and prepare
the accounts of the recruits.</p>

<p>Secondly&mdash;That those funds were received by the regimental paymaster
from the district paymaster, Mr. Eakins, who was then at
Albany, and not from Mr. Gallatin whom, it is believed, did not arrive till
after the regiment moved from Greenbush.</p>

<p>These facts can be corroborated by every officer of the 15th Infantry,
who one and all deem the paragraph published in the Herald a base
calumny, a direct attack on their honor as soldiers, and declare that the
author, whoever he may be, has asserted gross untruths. As for myself,
I have had the honor to serve in the army from the rank of volunteer to
the station I now hold, during the Administration of Gen. Washington,
Mr. Adams, Mr. Jefferson, and Mr. Madison, and can affirm that I
have known some troops under the three first to have been upward of a
year without a payment, and under the latter for eight months. This
was owing to the dispersed state of our troops on the western frontiers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXI" id="Page_LXXI">lxxi</a></span>
But never did I hear of a corps shewing a disposition to refuse to do
their duty, because they had not received their pay; nor do I believe the
American army has been disgraced by an instance of the kind since the
Revolutionary War. But ask any man of consideration, what time it
requires to organize an army, or a corps of new recruits&mdash;if, owing to the
want of a knowledge of the officers to forms of returns, accounts, etc., it
will not be some time before a new corps can be as well equipt, or
appear as much like soldiers, as an old one? Every soldier will reply
that it will require two years at least to teach both officers and men to
reap the same benefit from the same supplies as old soldiers. And
although at this time the 15th regiment has been as regularly supplied
as any other corps with clothing, pay, arms, and accoutrements, even to
watch coats to protect the centinel against the winter storms, yet were
there an old regiment laying by their side, who had received the same
supplies, they would most indubitably be better equipped and make
themselves more comfortable, having the saving of two or more years'
supplies on hand. But whether ill or well supplied, the soldiers and
officers have too just a sense of the duty they owe their country and their
own honor, ever to refuse to march against the enemy. And the colonel
begs leave to assure the author of the above paragraph, that he hopes he
will forbear any future attempt to injure his reputation by praising an
action which, if true, must have forever tarnished the small claim he now
has to a military character.</p>

<p>Colonel Pike seldom had occasion to make proclamations
of a politico-military character. But one such which he
issued while he was in command of a district may be here
cited. It is not dated, in the printed form before me, but
was no doubt given out in Jan., 1813, as it appears in Niles'
Register for the week ending Jan. 30th, III. No. 22,
p. 344:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>To all whom it may concern.</i> The state of hostility which exists between
the Kingdom of Great Britain and the United States makes it necessary
that the intercourse which may take place between this country and
the adjacent province of Canada should be regulated on the principles
which govern belligerent nations. I have had it in charge from the commanding
general, Chandler [John Chandler, of New Hampshire, d. 1841]
that no person should be permitted to pass in or out of Canada without
his permission, or, in his absence, the permission of the commandant of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXII" id="Page_LXXII">lxxii</a></span>
the district of Champlain. This order has been communicated to the
commanding officer on the lines, and will be strenuously enforced.</p>

<p>Some members of the community have been found so void of all sense
of honor, love of country, or any other principle which has governed the
virtuous of all nations and ages, as to hold correspondence with and give
intelligence to our enemies. It therefore becomes my duty to put the
laws in full force. The two following sections of the rules and articles
of war, which are equally binding on the citizen and the soldier, are published
for the information of the public, that no one may plead ignorance,
as from this time henceforward they shall be enforced with the greatest
severity.</p>

<p>"Art. 56. Whosoever shall relieve the enemy with money, victuals, or
ammunition, or shall knowingly harbor or protect an enemy shall suffer
<span class="smcap">death</span>, or such other punishment as shall be ordered by the sentence
of a court-martial.</p>

<p>"Art. 57. Whosoever shall be convicted of holding correspondence
with, or giving intelligence to, the enemy, either directly or indirectly,
shall suffer <span class="smcap">death</span>, or such other punishment as shall be ordered by the
sentence of a court-martial."</p>

<span class="i2"><i>Commanding West Lake Champlain</i>.</span></p>
</div>

<p>During the winter of 1812-13, when the 15th regiment
was stationed on the northern frontier, in view of the operations
to be undertaken against the posts of the enemy on
the lakes, great confidence in this well-disciplined and zealous
body of troops was felt by General Henry Dearborn,
formerly secretary of war, and then the senior major-general
of the army, in immediate command. As we have just seen,
General Pike was in charge of a military district on Lake
Champlain; his command was then of about 2,500 men.
Various desultory demonstrations against the enemy had
proved futile, in some cases fatuous and disgraceful. The
War Department determined upon a more consistent and
apparently feasible plan of concerted operations, which had
in view the reduction of all the British posts on the St.
Lawrence river and Lake Ontario. The capture of Kingston
(site of old Fort Frontenac) was a measure of first importance.
The garrison was supposed to be small, and lulled
in a sense of security, owing to the rigors of the season and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXIII" id="Page_LXXIII">lxxiii</a></span>
the numerical insignificance of our troops at Sackett's Harbor;
nor was Kingston likely to be re-enforced from below,
as the British forces were menaced on the Lower St. Lawrence
by Pike's troops on Lake Champlain. It was proposed
to transport these in sleighs to the foot of Lake
Ontario with such promptitude that the movement could
not be counteracted. General Dearborn also proposed to
concentrate other forces at Sackett's Harbor, to which place
his headquarters at Albany were to be moved at once. This
was in Feb., 1813. But while these measures were pending,
Sir George Prevost, Governor-General of the Canadas, prorogued
the Parliament then in session, and moved to Kingston
with re-enforcements for that place. According to
General Dearborn's dispatches of Mar. 3d from Sackett's
Harbor, this demonstration seemed so alarming that operations
against Kingston were suspended in favor of others
which had regard to the safety of Sackett's Harbor; though
it appears in General Armstrong's History of the War that
Sir George Prevost had executed a clever ruse with few
troops, and "countervailed his antagonist only by dexterous
and well-timed reports," Whiting's Pike, p. 290 <i>seq.</i></p>

<p>The proposed attack on Kingston over the ice having
been abandoned, the Secretary of War's alternative plan of
reducing in succession the several posts on and about Lake
Ontario engaged General Dearborn's attention. The Secretary
indicated the order in which the successive attacks
were to be made, viz.: Kingston and York on Lake Ontario;
George and Erie on the Niagara river. But this sequence was
not strictly regarded by General Dearborn, who determined
to attack Kingston last instead of first; considering the rotation
of the assaults to be of minor consequence, in view of
the main features of a campaign which had for its object
the reduction of all the posts named in the order of the
Secretary. The general commanding, on consultation with
Commodore Isaac Chauncey, concluded to make York
the initial point of attack; George to come next, and then
Kingston.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXIV" id="Page_LXXIV">lxxiv</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The prospect held out by this plan of the campaign was certainly
very promising. It had all such probabilities in its favor as could be
commanded by those who control only one side of the current of events.
The force that could and would be brought to bear on each point of
attack was ample, and left as little to hazard as prudence would suggest.
The plan was founded on the best principles of strategy, and highly
creditable to the generalship which dictated it. Had it been carried out
with the spirit and perseverance with which it was commenced, there
was every reasonable prospect of a successful issue. The causes of its
failure were obvious: delays, without proper objects, after the capture of
Fort George; and a change of command, wholly unnecessary and inexpedient,
which led to the waste of nearly an entire season of inactivity
(Whiting, p. 297).</p>
</div>

<p>As noted by this military critic and historian, General
Dearborn was relieved from command early in July, 1813,
his successor being enjoined to rest on his arms, except in
the event of certain improbable contingencies which never
arose, until the arrival of General Wilkinson, who did not
reach Fort George until September, or resume operations
until Oct. 1st; so that "nearly three months were utterly
wasted by a body of 4,000 troops."</p>

<p>But I have digressed from the attack on Fort York, with
which alone are we here concerned.</p>

<p>In the latter part of April, 1813, the navigation of Lake
Ontario was open, and no molestation was apprehended, as
it was known that Sir James Yeo's fleet was not operative.
Agreeably with the plan of the campaign above briefly
noted, therefore, General Dearborn embarked on board Commodore
Chauncey's fleet, with about 1,700 troops, under the
immediate command of Brigadier-General Pike, Apr. 25th.
On the morning of the 27th the fleet reached York harbor,
where it was intended to debark for the assault on Fort
York. This military post defended the place which had
been known as Toronto till 1793, and was then called York
till 1834, when it resumed its aboriginal name.</p>

<p class="p2">The true signification of the Iroquois word which has
settled in the form <i>Toronto</i>, after long fluctuation of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXV" id="Page_LXXV">lxxv</a></span>
its vowels, is uncertain, or at any rate, is still questioned.
It is now most frequently translated "trees in the water,"
or by some equivalent phrase, with reference to the formerly
wooded, long, low spit of land which still encompasses
the harbor of Ontario's metropolis. Irrespective of its etymology,
the various connotations of <i>Toronto</i> in successive
historical periods are to be carefully discriminated. If we
turn to old maps, we see that the present Georgian bay of
Lake Huron was Toronto bay; the present Lake Simcoe
was Toronto lake; present Severn river and the Humber
were each of them Toronto river. In the seventeenth
century, Toronto was the official designation of a region
between Lake Simcoe and the Georgian bay&mdash;the country
of the Hurons, on the large peninsula which intervenes
between Lake Huron and Lake Ontario. The comparatively
narrow neck of this peninsula offered, by means of
Humber river and certain portages, a convenient way to
pass between these two great lakes&mdash;it was, in fact, an
Indian thoroughfare. The mouth of the Humber consequently
became an Indian rendezvous, and the name of the
whole region thus became best known in connection with
the locality of the present city. As the southern terminus
of this highway, on Lake Ontario, offered an eligible site
for a trading-post, advantage was taken of such an opportunity
to cut off trade from Chouagen (Oswego) by planting
the original establishment of the Whites near the mouth
of the Humber. Such was the French Fort RouillÃ©, built
in 1749, and named in compliment to Antoine Louis
RouillÃ©, Comte de Jouy, then colonial minister. This post
was destroyed in 1756, to prevent it from falling into the
hands of the English. It became better known as Fort
Toronto than it had been by its proper French name, and
later on passed into history as Old Fort Toronto, in distinction
from the two other establishments to which the
name was successively bequeathed. Fort RouillÃ©, by whatever
name called, was never lost sight of entirely. Lossing's
Field Book of the War of 1812, New York, 1868, p. 593, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXVI" id="Page_LXXVI">lxxvi</a></span>
a cut which shows its appearance when it had been to some
extent renovated in 1812-13. The exact site is now marked
by a monument, lying alongside which is an inscribed stone.
These memorials are pointed out to visitors, on the lake
shore, in the southwest corner of the present Exposition
grounds, on the western side of the city of Toronto. After
the abandonment of old Fort RouillÃ© the region round
about remained for nearly half a century a wild whose solitude
may have been only relieved by the lodges of a few
Misisagas&mdash;those Indians of Ojibwa affinities who had
become members of the Iroquois confederation in 1746,
three years before the fort was built. In 1791, Upper and
Lower Canada were instituted by parliamentary measures
which Pitt guided to success; the latter was practically the
province of Quebec; the former became the province of
Ontario, the refuge and future home of the United Empire
Loyalists. For the capital of Ontario, a site was to be
chosen in then unbroken wilds. The first provincial Parliament
of the new province of Upper Canada was held in
May, 1793, at Newark, the present town of Niagara, where
the river of that name enters Lake Ontario. But this place
was ineligible; the river became an international boundary;
the guns of the United States Fort Niagara could be
trained upon Newark; and in August of the same year the
seat of government of the new province was transferred to
the new site which had been surveyed to that end by
Bouchette, and selected for the purpose by General and
Governor John Graves Simcoe (b. Feb. 25th, 1752, d. Oct.
6th, 1806). To this place Simcoe gave the name of York,
after the duke, second son of George III. The evolution
of this embryo of future greatness was slow; for many
years "Little York," or "Muddy York," as it was styled
by some in derision, had but a few hundred inhabitants;
its maintenance was mainly due to the United Loyalists
already mentioned. In April, 1813, the works by which
York was defended, and which General Pike carried by
assault, were those called Fort York; later they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXVII" id="Page_LXXVII">lxxvii</a></span>
known as Fort Toronto, or "the Fort at Toronto." The
town which Simcoe had christened York did not resume
the original designation of the locality till 1834, when it
was incorporated as the city of Toronto.</p>

<p>This magnificent metropolis, which so admirably illustrates
the effect of American momentum upon English
stability, is situated upon the north side of Lake Ontario,
39 miles northeast of Hamilton (which occupies the <i>fond
du lac</i>) and 310 miles west-southwest of Montreal; at the
observatory the position is calculated to be in latitude 43Â°
39Â´ 35Â´Â´ N. and longitude 79Â° 23Â´ 39Â´Â´ W. of the Greenwich
meridian. The city extends westward from the vicinity of
the Don in the direction of the Humber, across the small
stream known as Garrison creek. It thus has several miles
of lake front on the south, at the bay or harbor of Toronto,
partly shut off from the lake by low land which was once
a peninsula, and some small islands, with an entrance only
from the west; but the peninsula has been artificially cut
off from the mainland. At its end stood a blockhouse, in
a position known as Gibraltar point; another blockhouse
stood at the mouth of the Don, on the left or east bank of
that river. One now drives a few blocks from any hotel in
the heart of the city to "old" Fort York, at present dismantled,
but very much in evidence still of the scene of
General Pike's victory and mortal hurt. The visitor will be
warned off the premises by the functionary who has these
<i>disjecta membra</i> in charge, as Lossing had been before I
was; but may nevertheless keep on the main street or road
through the frowning earthworks, and will presently find
himself on Garrison Common. This is the large level piece
of ground, the middle of the lake front of which is occupied
by the present barracks, or "new fort." At points
included within the present garrison and parade ground
were the positions of two outer defenses of old Fort York,
respectively called at that time the Western and the Half
Moon battery; these were the first and second obstacles
for Pike to surmount in advancing upon the main defenses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXVIII" id="Page_LXXVIII">lxxviii</a></span>
of York. Crossing Garrison Common in a few minutes we
enter the Exposition grounds, at the further corner of
which, to the left, and directly upon the lake shore, stand the
RouillÃ© monument and inscribed cairn already mentioned,
together with a historical cabin; a pier juts into the lake
close by these objects. The direct distance between the
RouillÃ© monument and old Fort York is about 6,000 feet&mdash;little
over a mile by the road; the present barracks are
nearly midway between those two places. Old Fort York
occupies a position about the mouth of Garrison creek,
between Front Street and the water's edge, at the foot of
Tecumseh Street, and close to Queen's Wharf, in the midst
of railroad tracks, freight houses, and depots. The magazine,
which was exploded at the cost of many American and
some British lives, stood in a depression at or near the
mouth of the creek, with its top nearly on a level with
higher ground on either hand; it is said that its existence
was not suspected by the enemy. It was a comparatively
large structure of its kind, solidly built of heavy stone
masonry, and contained a great quantity of powder, shot,
and shell. All the positions here in mention may be inspected
in a leisurely drive of an hour. Those who have
not been over the ground, or have not a city map at hand,
will be helped to a clear understanding of the situation by
the diagram given in Lossing, p. 590; together with the
sketches there given of York, of Fort York, of the magazine
which was blown up by General Sheaffe's order, and of
the Western battery whose explosion was accidental. Of
the latter, the picture represents the remains as they were
in 1860.</p>

<p>The conflicting accounts of uninformed, unconsciously
biased, or willfully mendacious writers have shrouded in
obscurity the clear and intelligible relation which can be
given of the battle of York. Especially have the two
explosions which occurred during the assault been confounded
and falsified in history. It is necessary, at the outset,
to dissociate in mind these two catastrophes, namely:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXIX" id="Page_LXXIX">lxxix</a></span>
(1) The accidental explosion of a portable magazine at the
Western battery during the advance of the Americans upon
the main works. (2) The intentional explosion of the fixed
magazine during the retreat of the British from the main
works. The latter was somewhat premature, owing to overmuch
zeal of the soldier who had been ordered to fire the
train; but it was premeditated.</p>

<p>A diligent comparison of many different descriptions of
the battle of York has satisfied me that the account in
Whiting, Pike's most formal biographer, leaves much to be
desired, and that Lossing's relation is decidedly preferable
in most particulars. The latter gives, on the whole, the
clearest and truest picture which any modern historian has
painted. Lossing consulted the official reports of the
commanders, both British and American; the accounts
given by Thompson, Perkins, James, Auchinleck, Armstrong,
Christy, Ingersoll, and others; Whiting's Biography
of Pike; Hough's County histories; Roger's Canadian History;
Smith's Canada; Cooper's Naval History; Niles'
Register; the Portfolio; the Analectic Magazine; he had
some manuscripts of actors in the scene, besides various
verbal relations; and he went over the ground in person.
In the following sketch I shall lean more heavily upon
Lossing than upon Whiting; but for numerous particulars
shall refer back of both to contemporaneous records and
official reports, on both sides. I shall also adduce a certain
obscure author, P. Finan, who is among those who witnessed
the fight, and who describes what he saw in his
little-known Journal of a Voyage to Quebec in the Year
1825, with Recollections of Canada during the late American
War in the Years 1812-13, Newry, printed by Alexander
Peacock, 1828. H. A. Fay's Collection of Official Documents,
etc., 1 vol., 8vo, New York, 1817, gives General Dearborn's
and Commodore Chauncey's reports to the Secretary of
War and of the Navy, respectively, and the terms of the
capitulation after the capture. Brannan's Official Letters,
etc., 1 vol., 8vo, Washington, 1823, gives in full Pike's vigorous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXX" id="Page_LXXX">lxxx</a></span>
and rigorous brigade order, pp. 144-146; the reports
said of Dearborn and of Chauncey; and various other
items. These and many other materials are also contained
in earlier form in Niles' Weekly Register, IV. Mar.-Sept.,
1813. What here follows is derived mainly from the
sources I have thus indicated, but also includes a certified
copy of the most important one of the original Sheaffe documents
in the Archives of Ontario at Ottawa.</p>

<p>General Pike's brigade order for the attack on York
appears as follows in Niles' Register, IV. pp. 229, 230:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Sackett's Harbor</span>, April 25, 1813.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brigade Order.</span> When the debarkation shall take place on the
enemy's shore, Major Forsyth's light troops, formed in four platoons,
shall be first landed. They will advance a small distance from the shore,
and form the chain to cover the landing of the troops. They will not
fire unless they discover the approach of a body of the enemy, but will
make prisoners of every person who may be passing, and send them to
the general. They will be followed by the regimental platoons of the
first brigade, with two pieces of Brooks' artillery, one on the right and
one on the left flank, covered by their musketry, and the small detachments
of riflemen of the 15th and 16th Infantry. Then will be landed
the three platoons of the reserve of the first brigade, under Major Swan.<a name="FNanchor_M-17" id="FNanchor_M-17" href="#Footnote_M-17" class="fnanchor">[M-17]</a>
Then Major Eustis, with his train of artillery, covered by his own
musketry. Then Colonel M'Clure's volunteers, in four platoons, followed
by the 21st regiment, in six platoons. When the troops shall move in
column, either to meet the enemy or take a position, it will be in the following
order, viz.: First, Forsyth's riflemen, with proper front and flank
guards; the regiments of the first brigade, with their pieces; then three
platoons of reserve; Major Eustis' train of artillery; volunteer corps;
21st regiment; each corps sending out proper flank guards. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXI" id="Page_LXXXI">lxxxi</a></span>
enemy shall be discovered in front, the riflemen will form the chain, and
maintain their ground until they have the signal (the preparative) or
receive orders to retire, at which they will retreat with the greatest
velocity, and form equally on the two flanks of the regiments of the first
brigade, and then renew their fire. The three reserve platoons of this
line under the orders of Major Swan, 100 yards in the rear of the colors,
ready to support any part which may show an unsteady countenance.
Major Eustis and his train will form in the rear of this reserve, ready
to act where circumstances may dictate.</p>

<p>The second line will be composed of the 21st Infantry in six platoons,
flanked by Colonel M'Clure's volunteers, equally divided as light troops.
The whole under the orders of Colonel Ripley.<a name="FNanchor_M-18" id="FNanchor_M-18" href="#Footnote_M-18" class="fnanchor">[M-18]</a></p>

<p>It is expected that every corps will be mindful of the honor of the
American arms, and the disgraces which have recently tarnished our
arms; and endeavor, by a cool and determined discharge of their duty,
to support the one and wipe off the other. The riflemen in front will
maintain their ground at all hazards, until ordered to retire, as will every
corps of the army. With an assurance of being duly supported, should
the commanding general find it prudent to withdraw the front line, he
will give orders to retire by the heads of platoons, covered by the riflemen;
and the second line will advance by the heads of platoons, pass
the intervals, and form the line, call in the light troops, and renew the
action. But the general may find it proper to bring up the second line
on one or both flanks, to charge in columns, or perform a variety of
man&oelig;uvres which it would be impossible to foresee. But as a general
rule, whatever may be the directions of lines at the commencement of
the action, the corps will form as before directed. If they then advance
in line, it may be in parallel eschelons of platoons, or otherwise, as the
ground or circumstances may dictate.</p>

<p>No man will load until ordered, except the light troops in front until
within a short distance of the enemy, and then charge bayonets; thus
letting the enemy see that we can meet them in their own weapons. Any
man firing or quitting his post without orders, must be put to instant
death, as an example may be necessary. Platoon officers will pay the
greatest attention to the coolness and aim of their men in the fire; their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXII" id="Page_LXXXII">lxxxii</a></span>
regularity and dressing in the charge. Courage and bravery in the field
do not more distinguish the soldier than humanity after victory; and
whatever examples the savage allies of our enemies may have given us,
the general confidently hopes that the blood of an unresisting or yielding
enemy will never stain the weapons of the soldiers of his column.</p>

<p>The unoffending citizens of Canada are many of them our own
countrymen, and the poor Canadians have been forced into the war.
Their property must therefore be held sacred, and any soldier who shall
so far neglect the honor of his profession as to be guilty of plundering
the inhabitants, shall, if convicted, be punished with death. But the
commanding general assures the troops that, should they capture a large
quantity of public stores, he will use his best endeavors to procure them
a reward from his government.</p>

<p>This order shall be read at the head of each corps and every field
officer shall carry a copy, in order that he may at any moment refer to
it; and give explanations to his subordinates.</p>

<p>All those found in arms in the enemy's country, shall be treated as
enemies; but those who are peaceably following the pursuits of their
various avocations, friends&mdash;and their property respected.</p>
<p class="left45">

<span class="i4">Assistant aid-de-camp.</span></p>
</div>

<p>Of quite another character than the foregoing order is the
next word which reaches us from General Pike&mdash;probably
from the last letter he ever wrote. It is always the soldier,
but now the son and not the officer who speaks, in this
letter addressed to his father. The extract is undated and
unsigned, but was penned at Brownsville, near Sackett's
Harbor, on the day before the expedition sailed from the
latter place. I cite from Niles' Register of Saturday, July
10th, 1813, p. 304, these affecting passages:</p>

<p>"I embark to-morrow in the fleet at Sackett's Harbor, at
the head of a column of 1,500 choice troops, on a secret
expedition. If success attends my steps, honor and glory
await my name&mdash;if defeat, still shall it be said we died like
brave men, and conferred honor, even in death, on the
<span class="smcap">American name</span>.</p>

<p>"Should I be the happy mortal destined to turn the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXIII" id="Page_LXXXIII">lxxxiii</a></span>
scale of war, will you not rejoice, O my father? May
Heaven be propitious, and smile on the cause of my
country. But if we are destined to fall, may my fall be
like Wolfe's&mdash;to sleep in the arms of victory."</p>

<p>His aspiration was answered, for he turned the scale of
war; his dream of glory came true, for he fell asleep, like
Wolfe, in the arms of victory!</p>

<p>Commodore Isaac Chauncey's fleet, which conveyed the
American troops from Sackett's Harbor to York, consisted
of 14 vessels: the Madison, flagship; Oneida, Fair American,
Hamilton, Governor Tompkins, Conquest, Asp, Pert,
Julia, Growler, Ontario, Scourge, Lady of the Lake, and
the transport Raven.</p>

<p>On that fateful 27th of April, 1813, about seven o'clock in
the morning, when this fleet had reached York, the intention
was to land the troops at old Fort RouillÃ©, whence the
advance to the assault of Fort York would have been only
about a mile, along the lake front, over the level ground of
present Garrison Common. But a strong east wind drove
the boats "a considerable distance" leeward, to some
wooded point in the direction of the Humber. Exactly
how far this was does not appear; but there is evidence
that it was not more than some fraction of a mile&mdash;probably
not as far west of Fort RouillÃ© as the latter was west of
Fort York. General Dearborn says, "about a mile and
a half" from Fort York, which would be about half a mile
west of Fort RouillÃ©; and the place called Grenadier Point
has been named in this connection. Doubtless the whole
of the troops were not landed at precisely the same spot.
General Dearborn remained with the fleet, which was to
bombard York after landing the troops under the command
of General Pike. The former's official report to Hon. John
Armstrong, Secretary of War, dated Headquarters, York,
Upper Canada, Apr. 28th, 1813, includes this passage
(Brannan, p. 149):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
I had been induced to confide the immediate command of the troops
in action to General Pike, from a conviction that he fully expected it, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXIV" id="Page_LXXXIV">lxxxiv</a></span>
would be much mortified at being deprived of the honor, which he highly
appreciated.</p>
</div>

<p>As rendered in Niles' Register, IV. p. 179, it is to the
same effect, but somewhat differently worded:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
To the general I had been induced to confide the immediate attack,
from a knowledge that it was his wish and that he would have been
mortified had it not been given to him.</p>
</div>

<p>We will hear from Pike himself once more before he falls.
It is before any landing has been effected. Forsyth's boats
are nearing the shore; they are fired upon from the woods,
but have not yet answered a shot. Pike is standing on the
deck of the flagship, surrounded by his staff, straining his
eager eyes impatiently at the boats, which he sees have been
driven beyond the intended point of debarkation. "'By
God! I can't stay here any longer!' and addressing himself
to his staff&mdash;'Come, jump into the boat!' which we immediately
did, the commodore having reserved a boat specially
for him and his suite; the little coxswain was ordered immediately
to steer for the middle of the fray, and the balls
whistled gloriously around; probably their number was
owing to seeing so many officers in one boat; but we
laughed at their clumsy efforts as we pressed forward with
well-pulled oars."<a name="FNanchor_M-20" id="FNanchor_M-20" href="#Footnote_M-20" class="fnanchor">[M-20]</a></p>

<p>The first troops which effected a landing were Forsyth's<a name="FNanchor_M-21" id="FNanchor_M-21" href="#Footnote_M-21" class="fnanchor">[M-21]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXV" id="Page_LXXXV">lxxxv</a></span>
Rifles, conveyed in two boats. Their debarkation was
promptly resisted by a choice body of light troops from
Fort York, consisting of a company of Glengary Fencibles,
with some Indians, under Major Givens. From an advantageous
position in the woods which had been taken up, the
enemy opened a galling fire as our troops left the boats.
Concerning this opening engagement I cite Whiting, pp.
300-303:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The riflemen were formed on the bank as promptly as possible, when
the boats returned to the fleet for other troops. In the meantime, this
gallant little band, assisted by some few other troops that were thrown
on shore in other boats, sustained the brunt of the combat. The
numbers in this initial struggle were about equal, and it became a fair
and close fight, to be turned either way as re-enforcements should happen
to arrive. The British light troops were choice men, and commanded
by a brave officer.</p>

<p>Forsyth's men were undisciplined, but had seen some desultory service
on the Ogdensburg frontier, and had unbounded confidence in their
leader, who was rather an extraordinary man, and regarded as a most
promising partisan officer. He had peculiar notions as to the manner
of training men. The common rules of discipline were looked upon by
him with the utmost contempt. All he seemed to require of those under
him was, that they should be good marksmen, and ready to follow
him....</p>

<p>At the time of this expedition, Major Forsyth was a fat man, probably
weighing some 200 pounds. The uniform of his men was green, and, at
the time he landed, he wore a broad-skirted coat of that color, which was
unbuttoned and thrown back, displaying a white vest spread over his
ample chest, that afforded a mark for an enemy equal to the chalked circle
of a common infantry target. He had on his head a broad-brimmed
black hat. Soon after the landing, the armorer of his regiment, a
favorite of both himself and his men, was killed. The skill of this man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXVI" id="Page_LXXXVI">lxxxvi</a></span>
was such as enabled him to give the rifle its most deadly character;
and the efficiency of the regiment was consequently supposed, both by
officers and men, to depend much upon him. When he fell, every man
felt as if a deed had been perpetrated by the enemy that demanded
revenge; and the whole detachment, from Major Forsyth down to the
most indifferent marksman, entered into the combat with a fierce spirit of
retaliation that, no doubt, contributed much to the obstinacy of the stand
they made, and the unusual loss sustained by the enemy immediately
opposed to them.</p>

<p>Taking to the woods in which the British light troops were posted, the
riflemen, after their loose manner, placed themselves behind trees, and
thus carried on the contest with their more concentrated, better ordered,
and, therefore, more exposed opponents. It is said that Major Forsyth
continued, throughout the action, to move to and fro, armed only with a
light sword, immediately in the rear of his men, pointing out with an
earnest solemnity that partook both of sorrow and anger, to one rifleman
and another, some one of the enemy, and exclaiming that he was the
man who had killed the favorite armorer. This suggestion was almost
sure to be fatal to the enemy thus specially branded with the guilt of
having taken off the best man of the corps. The British light troops
were nearly all left on the ground they first occupied, being too strong to
retreat while the landing was only partially made, and too much exposed
to stand before such expertness of aim, rendered so fierce and unyielding
by one of the chance shots of an opening fight.</p>
</div>

<p>The force under Forsyth was soon supported by Major
King's<a name="FNanchor_M-22" id="FNanchor_M-22" href="#Footnote_M-22" class="fnanchor">[M-22]</a> battalion of the 15th Infantry, consisting of three
companies&mdash;Captain John Scott's, Captain White Youngs',
and that of Captain John Lambert Hoppock, who had been
mortally wounded in the boats. When General Pike had
landed with the whole body of his troops, the attacking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXVII" id="Page_LXXXVII">lxxxvii</a></span>
force was represented by the 6th, 15th, 16th, and 21st Infantry,
Colonel Maclure's 3d regiment of New York Militia,
and several pieces of artillery.</p>

<p>At the first sharp collision, as we have seen, the British
were defeated, not without much loss on both sides. On
their retreat, the bugles sounded the advance, and the
troops pressed forward along the lake shore toward Fort
York, which was meanwhile bombarded from the fleet.
One of General Pike's staff says: "Our march was by the
lake road in sections, but the route was so much intersected
by streams and rivulets, the bridges over which had been
destroyed by the enemy as they retreated, that we were
considerably retarded in our progress. We collected logs,
and by severe efforts at length contrived to pass over one
field piece and a howitzer, which were placed at the head of
our column, in charge of Captain Fanning<a name="FNanchor_M-23" id="FNanchor_M-23" href="#Footnote_M-23" class="fnanchor">[M-23]</a> of the 3d Artillery;
and thus we proceeded through a spacious wood, as
we emerged from which we were saluted by a battery of 24-pounders.
The general then ordered one of his aids (Fraser)
and a sergeant to proceed to the right of the battery, in
order to discover how many men were in the works. We
did so, and reported to him the number, and that they were
spiking their own guns. The general immediately ordered
Captain Walworth of the 16th [<i>sic</i>] with his company of
grenadiers to make the assault. Walworth gallantly ordered
his men to trail arms and advance at the accelerated pace;
but at the moment when they were ordered to recover and
charge the enemy, the enemy broke in the utmost confusion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXVIII" id="Page_LXXXVIII">lxxxviii</a></span>
leaving several men wounded on the ground which they
abandoned."</p>

<p>This first serious obstacle to Pike's advance was the
Western battery already described, <a href="#Page_LXXVII">p. lxxvii</a>, where the explosion
occurred before Captain Walworth<a name="FNanchor_M-24" id="FNanchor_M-24" href="#Footnote_M-24" class="fnanchor">[M-24]</a> could carry out
the order to charge this work. This accident caused some
loss of life to the defenders, but none to the assaulters.
Lossing has, concerning it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The wooden magazine of the battery, that had been carelessly left
open, blew up, killing some of the men, and seriously damaging the defences.
The dismayed enemy spiked their cannon and fled to the next,
or Half Moon battery. Walworth pressed forward, when that, too, was
abandoned, and he found nothing within but spiked cannon. Sheaffe
and his little army, deserted by the Indians, fled to the garrison near the
governor's house, and there opened fire upon the Americans. Pike
ordered his troops to halt, and lie flat upon the grass, while Major
Eustis,<a name="FNanchor_M-25" id="FNanchor_M-25" href="#Footnote_M-25" class="fnanchor">[M-25]</a> with his artillery battery, moved to the front, and soon silenced
the great guns of the enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>Finan is more circumstantial in describing the casualty
which did so much to decide the fate of the day:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
While this part of our force was contending with the enemy in the
woods, an unfortunate accident occurred in the battery opposed to the
fleet which proved a death blow to the little hope that might have been
entertained of a successful issue to the proceedings of the day. A gun
was aimed at one of the vessels, and the officers, desirous of seeing if the
ball would take effect, ascended the bastion: In the meantime the artilleryman,
waiting for the word of command to fire, held the match behind
him, as is usual under such circumstances; and the traveling magazine,
a large wooden chest, containing cartridges for the great guns, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_LXXXIX" id="Page_LXXXIX">lxxxix</a></span>
open just at his back, he unfortunately put the match into it and the
consequence, as may be supposed, was dreadful indeed! Every man in
the battery was blown into the air, and the dissection of the greater
part of their bodies was inconceivably shocking! The officers were
thrown from the bastion by the shock, but escaped with a few bruises;
the cannons were dismounted, and consequently the battery was rendered
completely useless.</p>

<p>I was standing at the gate of the garrison when the poor soldiers who
escaped the explosion with a little life remaining, were brought in to the
hospital, and a more afflicting sight could scarcely be witnessed. Their
faces were completely black, resembling those of the blackest Africans;
their hair frizzled like theirs, and their clothes scorched and emitting an
effluvia so strong as to be perceived long before they reached one. One
man in particular presented an awful spectacle: he was brought in a
wheelbarrow, and from his appearance I should be inclined to suppose
that almost every bone in his body was broken; he was lying in a powerless
heap, shaking about with every motion of the barrow, from which
his legs hung dangling down, as if only connected with his body by
the skin, while his cries and groans were of the most heart-rending
description.</p>

<p>Although Spartan valour was evinced by our little party, it proved unavailing
against the numbers that pressed them upon all sides; and in
consequence of the loss of the battery, and the reduction that had been
made in the number of our troops, their ground was no longer tenable;
but after nobly and desperately withstanding their enemies for several
hours, a retreat towards the garrison became inevitable, although every
inch of the ground was obstinately disputed.</p>
</div>

<p>It is remarkable that Whiting's relation of the attack has
nothing about this marked affair; it is in fact impossible to
follow the course of events in his narrative, between the
conclusion of the opening engagement and the final explosion
of the main magazine. Lossing, having brought
our troops to a halt, when they were lying upon the grass,
continues with the result of Major Eustis' operations:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The firing from the garrison ceased and the Americans expected every
moment to see a white flag displayed from the blockhouse in token of
surrender. Lieut. Riddle<a name="FNanchor_M-26" id="FNanchor_M-26" href="#Footnote_M-26" class="fnanchor">[M-26]</a> was sent forward to reconnoitre. General
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XC" id="Page_XC">xc</a></span>
Pike, who had just assisted, with his own hands, in removing a wounded
soldier to a comfortable place, was sitting upon a stump conversing with
a huge British sergeant<a name="FNanchor_M-27" id="FNanchor_M-27" href="#Footnote_M-27" class="fnanchor">[M-27]</a> who had been taken prisoner, his staff standing
around him. At that moment was felt a sudden tremor of the ground,
followed by a tremendous explosion near the British garrison. The
enemy, despairing of holding the place, had blown up their powder
magazine, situated upon the edge of the water at the mouth of a ravine,
near where the buildings of the Great Western Railway stand. The
effect was terrible. Fragments of timber, and huge stones of which the
magazine walls were built, were scattered in every direction over a space
of several hundred yards. When the smoke floated away, the scene was
appalling. Fifty-two Americans lay dead, and 180 were wounded. So
badly had the affair been managed that 40 of the British also lost their
lives by the explosion.<a name="FNanchor_M-28" id="FNanchor_M-28" href="#Footnote_M-28" class="fnanchor">[M-28]</a></p>
</div>

<p>General Armstrong states, in his History of the War of
1812, that General Sheaffe said this explosion was accidental,
his own soldiers having been involved in its effects.
General Whiting repeats this. But both Armstrong and
Whiting are clearly in error. If General Sheaffe ever said
this, he said what he knew was untrue. His words&mdash;such
as they may have been&mdash;may have referred to the earlier
explosion at the Western battery and been mistaken to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCI" id="Page_XCI">xci</a></span>
apply to the main explosion. We have his own reiterated
writings, that the magazine was exploded by his order.
One of these statements is made in a hurried letter, whose
almost illegible handwriting betrays the state of mind to
which this gentleman had been reduced. It was written
while he was on his retreat to Kingston, and is addressed to
his superior officer, Sir George Prevost. The published
text before me reads in part as follows (italics editorial):</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Haldimand</span>, 30th April.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir George</span>,&mdash;I have the mortification of reporting to you
that York is in the possession of the enemy, it having on the 27th inst.
been attacked by a force too powerful to resist with success. Sixteen
vessels of various descriptions full of men, including their new ship the
Madison, formed their flotilla. The Grenadiers of the King's suffered
first in the action with the enemy (in which Captain W. Neale was
killed), and afterwards severely, in connection with other corps, by the
accidental explosion of a battery magazine, which at the same time disabled
the battery. <i>I caused our grand magazine to be blown up....</i></p>

<p class="left25">
I am, my dear Sir George, your very faithfully devoted servant,<br />
<span class="smcap i2">R. H. Sheaffe</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Another letter from General Sheaffe, dated Kingston,
May 5th, when he had become more composed in mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCII" id="Page_XCII">xcii</a></span>
than he seems to have been during his inglorious if not disgraceful
flight, gives a more coherent account and many
further details. I cite it in full, from the original MS. now
in the Department of Archives at Ottawa, as kindly copied
and certified for me by Mr. L. P. Sylvain of the Library of
Parliament:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Kingston</span>, 5<sup>th</sup> May, 1813.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>I did myself the honour of writing to Your Excellency on my route
from York to communicate the mortifying intelligence that the Enemy
had obtained possession of that place on the 27<sup>th</sup> of April, and I shall
now enter into a fuller detail, than I was enabled to do at the date of that
letter.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 26<sup>th</sup> of April I received information that many
Vessels had been seen from the Highlands to the Eastward of York,
soon after daylight the next morning the Enemy's Vessels were discovered
lying to not far from the shore of the peninsula in front of the town;
they soon afterwards, sixteen in number of various descriptions, made
sail with a fresh breeze from the [<i>p. 2</i>] eastward, led by the Ship lately
built at Sackett's harbour, and anchored off the point where the french fort
[RouillÃ©] formerly stood; many boats full of troops were soon discovered
assembling near the Commander's Ship, apparently with an intention of
effecting a landing on the ground off which he was anchored: our troops
were ordered into the Ravine in the rear of the Government Garden
and fields; Major Givens and the Indians with him were sent forward
through the wood to oppose the landing of the Enemy&mdash;the Company of
Glengary Light Infantry was directed to support them, and the Militia
not having arrived at the Ravine, The Grenadiers of the King's Regiment
and the small portion of the Royal Newfoundland Fencibles
belonging to the Garrison of York were moved on, led by L<sup>t</sup> Colonel
Heathcote of that corps, commanding the Garrison; this movement was
directed to be made within the wood, [<i>p. 3</i>] parallel to the Lake-side, and
only so far from it, as not to be discovered by the Enemy's Vessels, several
of which were not at a great distance from the shore: Captain
Eustace's company of the King's Regiment, and some Militia that were
quartered at the east end of the town, and had been left there during
the night, lest the Enemy might make some attempt on that flank, were
ordered, with the exception of a small party of the Militia, to join these
troops&mdash;which was soon effected: while these operations were going on
Major General Shaw, Adjudant General of Militia led a portion of the
Militia on a road at the back of the wood to watch our rear, and to act
according to circumstances; by some mistake he led the Glengary company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCIII" id="Page_XCIII">xciii</a></span>
away from the direction assigned to it, to accompany this detachment,
so that it came late into action, instead of being near the Indians
at its commencement; the movement of the other troops was retarded
[<i>p. 4</i>] by the difficulty of the wood, while the Enemy being aided by the
wind, rapidly gained the shore under cover of a fire from the commodore's
ship and other vessels, and landed in spite of a spirited opposition
from major Givens and his small band of Indians; the Enemy was
shortly afterwards encountered by our handful of troops, Captain McNeal
of the King's Regiment was early killed while gallantly leading his Company
which suffered severely: the troops fell back. I succeeded in rallying
them several times, and a detachment of the King's with some Militia,
whom I had placed near the edge of the wood to protect our left Flank
repulsed a column of the Enemy which was advancing along the bank at
the Lake side: but our troops could not maintain the contest against
the greatly superior and increasing numbers of the Enemy&mdash;they retired
under cover of our batteries, which were engaged with some of their
Vessels, that had begun to beat up towards [<i>p. 5</i>] the harbour, when their
troops landed, occasionally firing, and had anchored at a short distance to
the westward of the line from the Barracks to Gibraltar Point; from that
situation they kept up a heavy fire on our batteries, on the Block House
and Barracks, and on the communications between them, some of their
Guns being thirty two pounders; to return their fire, we had two complete
twelve pounders, and old condemned guns without trunnions (&mdash;&mdash;
eighteen &mdash;&mdash; pounders) which, after being proved had been stocked
and mounted under the direction of Lieut. Ingouville of the Royal Newfoundland
Regiment, whom I had appointed Assistant Engineer; a twelve
pounder of the same description was added during the Engagement;
with these defective means the Enemy was kept at bay for some time,
<i>when, by some unfortunate accident, the traveling Magazine at the
Western battery blew up and killed and wounded a considerable number
of men</i> [italics editorial]; many of them belonging to the [<i>p. 6</i>]
Grenadier Company of the King's Regiment, the battery was crippled,
the platform being torn up, and one of the eighteen pounders overturned:
the Magazine was replaced and the battery restored to some
order, but it was evident that our numbers and means of defence were
inadequate to the task of maintaining possession of York against the
vast superiority of force brought against it, though providentially little
mischief had hitherto been done by the long continued cannonade of
the Enemy, except to some of the buildings: <i>the troops were withdrawn
towards the town, and the grand Magazine was at the same time
blown up</i> [italics editorial], the Enemy was so near to it, that he sustained
great loss, and was, for a time, driven back by the explosion;
some of our own troops were not beyond the reach of fragments of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCIV" id="Page_XCIV">xciv</a></span>
stone, though they escaped with very little injury; Captain Loring, my
aide-de-camp, received a severe contusion, and [<i>p. 7</i>] the horse he rode
was killed.</p>

<p>The troops were halted at a ravine not far to the westward of the
ship yard, I there consulted with the Superior Officers, and it being too
apparent that a further opposition would but render the result more
disastrous, some of the Enemy's vessels indicating an intention to move
up the harbour, in order to co-operate with their land forces, I ordered
the troops of the line to retreat on the road to Kingston, which was
effected without any annoyance from the Enemy; when we had proceeded
some miles we met the Light Company of the King's Regiment
on its march for Fort George, I had sent an express the preceding evening
to hasten its movement, but it was at too great a distance to be able
to join us at York.</p>

<p>The ship on the stocks and the naval stores were destroyed to prevent
the Enemy from getting possession of them. [<i>p. 8</i>] An attempt to set
fire to the Gloucester that was fitting out for purposes of transport,
proved abortive; she was aground a mere hulk, her repairs not being
half finished: I have been informed that the enemy succeeded in getting
her off, and putting her into a state to be towed away; a number of
shipwrights having arrived from Sackett's harbour with the expectation
of employing them in a similar task on our new ship.</p>

<p>The accounts of the number of the Enemy landed vary from eighteen
hundred and ninety to three thousand [!], our force consisted of a Bombardier
and twelve Gunners of the Royal Artillery to assist whom men
were drawn from other corps, two companies of the 8th or King's Regiment,
one of them, the Grenadiers, being on its route for Fort George,
about a company in number, of the Royal [<i>p. 9</i>] Newfoundland regiment,
and one of the Glengary Light Infantry, and about three hundred
Militia and Dock Yard men; the quality of some of these troops was of
so superior a description, and their general disposition so good, that
under less unfavourable circumstances we might have repulsed the
Enemy in spite of his numbers, or have made him pay dearly for success;
as it was, according to the reports that have reached me, his loss
was much greater than ours, a return of which I have the honour of
transmitting, except of that of the Militia, of which a return has not yet
been received; but I believe it to have been inconsiderable: Donald
McLean Esqr Clerk of the House of Assembly gallantly volunteered his
services with a musket, and was killed.</p>

<p>[<i>p. 10</i>] Captain Jarvis of the Incorporated Militia, a meritorious
Officer, who had a share in the successes at Detroit and Queenston, had
been sent with a party of Militia in three batteaux for the Militia
Clothing, which had been left on the road from Kingston, he came to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCV" id="Page_XCV">xcv</a></span>
during the action to report his arrival, and soon afterwards he was
severely wounded: a few of the Indians (Missasagus &amp; Chipeways)
were killed and wounded, among the latter were two chiefs.</p>

<p>Thinking it highly probable that the Enemy would pay an early visit
to York, I had remained there long beyond the period I had originally
assigned for my departure to fort George, in order to expedite the preparations
which the means in my power enabled me to make for the
defence of the place; Your [<i>p. 11</i>] Excellency knows that I had
intended to place Colonel Myers, Acting Quarter Master General, in the
command there, at least for a time; I afterwards learnt that Colonel
Young was in movement towards me with the 8th or King's Regt. I
then decided to give him the Command to avoid the inconvenience of
seperating (<i>sic</i>) the head of a department from me, and being informed
that he was to move up by himself as speedily as possible, I was for
some time in daily expectation of seeing him; at length, having reason
to believe that he was to accompany one of the divisions of his Regiment,
I wrote to him both by the land and by the water route to come
to me without delay; about the 25th of April I received certain intelligence,
of what had been [<i>p. 12</i>] before rumoured, that he was detained
at Kingston by a severe illness, and on the 26th I learnt that Colonel
Myers was to leave Fort George that day for York, I therefore determined
to wait for his arrival, and to leave him in the command until Colonel
Young might be in a state to relieve him; it was in the evening of
the same day that I heard of the approach of the Enemy: I have
thought it proper to enter into this explanation, as Your Excellency may
have expected that I had returned to Fort George before the period at
which the attack was made on York. I propose remaining here until I
shall have received Your Excellency's Commands.</p>

<p class="left45">
I have the honour to be,<br />
<span class="i2">With great respect,</span><br />

</div>

<p>Here is the clear and intelligible testimony of the British
commanding general to the facts that there were two explosions,
one of which was accidental and destructive to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCVI" id="Page_XCVI">xcvi</a></span>
own men, the other designed and executed by his own command.
It is believed to have been a little premature, in the
confusion of an evacuation that was nothing short of a rout,
before the defenders were quite out of reach of its effects;
but that they suffered little from what wrought such havoc
with the Americans, is incontestable. The ethics of the
catastrophe I leave to be discussed by professional military
critics; but it seems to me that General Sheaffe was justified
in inflicting the utmost possible injury upon the enemy, and
that he would have been chargeable with culpable neglect of
duty if he had allowed valuable munitions of war to fall into
their hands.</p>

<p>Before resuming the main thread of this painful narration
I will introduce two accounts, both by eye-witnesses.</p>

<p>One of these is contained in an extract of a letter from a
field officer in the force which landed at York, name not
given, to the War Department, as published in Niles' Register,
IV. p. 193. It is explicit regarding both explosions,
though loose in statement of numbers killed by each, and
in some other respects:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The column of attack consisted of the 6th, 15th, 16th, and 21st regiments
of infantry, and a detachment of the light and heavy artillery.
Major Forsyth's corps of riflemen, and Lieut. Col. M'Clure's corps of
volunteers acted on the flanks. There was a long piece of woods to go
through, which offered many obstructions to our heavy ordnance. As
was expected, we were there annoyed on our flanks by a part of the
British and Indians, with a six-pounder and two howitzers. One of the
enemies batteries [the Western] accidentally blew up, by which they lost
50 men of the 8th regiment. A part of our force was detached from our
column, as it came into the open ground, who carried the second battery
by storm. The troops were halted a few minutes to bring up the heavy
artillery to play on the blockhouse. General Sheaffe, despairing of holding
the town, ordered fire to be put to the magazine, in which there were
500 barrels of powder, many cart loads of stone, and an immense quantity
of iron, shells and shot. The explosion was tremendous. The
column was raked from front to rear. General Pike and his three aids,
and 250 officers and men were killed or wounded in the column. Notwithstanding
this calamity and the discomfiture that might be expected
to follow it, the troops gave three cheers, instantly formed the column,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCVII" id="Page_XCVII">xcvii</a></span>
and marched on toward the town. General Sheaffe fled and left his
papers and baggage behind him.<a name="FNanchor_M-29" id="FNanchor_M-29" href="#Footnote_M-29" class="fnanchor">[M-29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Finan gives a vivid picture of what he saw of the catastrophe.
It must be taken with some allowance, perhaps,
for the force of the impression which the terrible scene
made upon him at the moment, and the subsequent insistence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCVIII" id="Page_XCVIII">xcviii</a></span>
with which his memory dwelt upon such a spectacle;
but it can hardly be much overdrawn:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
The governor's house, with some smaller buildings, formed a square,
at the center battery, and under it the grand magazine, containing a large
quantity of powder, was situated. As there were only two or three guns
at this battery, and it but a short distance from the garrison, the troops
did not remain in it, but retreated to the latter. When the Americans
commanded by one of their best generals, Pike, reached this small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XCIX" id="Page_XCIX">xcix</a></span>
battery, instead of pressing forward, they halted, and the general sat
down on one of the guns; a fatal proceeding&mdash;for, in a few minutes, his
advance guard, consisting of about 300 men and himself, were blown
into the air by the explosion of the grand magazine.</p>

<p>Some time before this horrible circumstance took place, the vessels
had commenced firing upon the garrison, which obliged the females, and
children, &amp;c. to leave it; we therefore retired into the country, to
the house of an officer of the militia, where we remained a short time;
but feeling anxious to know the fate of the day, I left the house without
the knowledge of my mother, and was proceeding toward the garrison
when the explosion took place. I heard the report, and felt a tremendous
motion in the earth, resembling the shock of an earthquake; and, looking
towards the spot, I saw an immense cloud ascend into the air. I was
not aware at the moment what it had been occasioned by, but it had
an awfully grand effect; at first it was a great confused mass of smoke,
timber, men, earth, &amp;c. but as it rose, in a most majestic manner, it
assumed the shape of a vast balloon. When the whole mass had
ascended to a considerable height, and the force by which the timber,
&amp;c. were impelled upwards became spent, the latter fell from the cloud
and spread over the surrounding plain. I stopped to observe the cloud,
which preserved its round shape while it remained within my view. I
then advanced towards the garrison, but had not proceeded much farther
until I discovered our little party collected in a close body between the
town and that place, which latter they had been obliged to evacuate.</p>
</div>

<p>It is said, "Death loves a shining mark." One of the
missiles that hurtled down on that devoted band sought out
their heroic leader with fatal effect. A piece of rock fell on
General Pike's back, and "broke in upon the very springs of
life," to use Whiting's words. A sadly realistic memento of
the speedily fatal injury reaches us from one of his aids,
who was by his side and was himself gravely wounded.
Lieutenant Fraser says, in a private letter he wrote by
Pike's special injunction, which appeared in the Aurora, and
afterward in Niles' Register, IV. p. 225: "Without the
honor of a personal acquaintance, I address you at the particular
order of the late General Pike. After he had been
mortally wounded, his words were exactly these: '...
I am mortally wounded&mdash;my ribs and back are stove in&mdash;write
my friend D... and tell him what you know of
the battle&mdash;and to comfort my ....' Some things else
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_C" id="Page_C">c</a></span>
he said, on which I shall again write you; and many things
he said for your ear have escaped me through the severity of
my own bruises."</p>

<p>The dying general was carried to a boat at the lake side
and conveyed to the Pert, whence he was taken aboard
the flagship Madison. Some recorded words of his last
moments need not be scanned with critical eye. When
those who bore their fallen leader reached the boat the
huzza of the troops fell upon his ears. "What does it
mean?" he feebly asked. "Victory!" was the reply; "the
Union Jack is coming down, General&mdash;the Stars and Stripes
are going up!" The dying hero's face lighted up with a
smile of ecstasy. His spirit lingered a few hours. Before
the end came, the British flag was brought to him. He
made a sign to place it under his head; and thus he
expired.<a name="FNanchor_M-30" id="FNanchor_M-30" href="#Footnote_M-30" class="fnanchor">[M-30]</a></p>

<p>Military history hardly furnishes a closer parallel than
that between the death of Pike before York and of Wolfe
before Quebec. Each led to the assault; each conquered;
each fell in the arms of victory; each is said to have
pillowed his head on the stricken colors of the defenders.
On the other hand, no contrast could be more obtrusive
than that between the fall of Brock before Queenstown
Heights and the conduct of his successor, Sheaffe, at York.
The latter fled on the heels of disaster across the Don and
on toward Kingston; even his personal baggage and papers
fell into the hands of his enemy; the very terms of the
surrender of York were agreed upon by others, in the
absence of its late defender. But it is needless to pursue
this subject. General Sheaffe has by none been more
severely criticised than by British writers.</p>

<p>When General Pike fell, the command devolved by seniority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CI" id="Page_CI">ci</a></span>
upon Colonel Pearce,<a name="FNanchor_M-31" id="FNanchor_M-31" href="#Footnote_M-31" class="fnanchor">[M-31]</a> of the 16th Infantry, until General
Dearborn arrived upon the scene. Lieutenant Riddle's
detachment was so near the place of explosion that it
escaped the deadly shower; but the Americans scattered
in dismay at the catastrophe. They were rallied by
Brigade-Major Hunt and Lieutenant-Colonel Mitchell of
the 3d Artillery. The column was formed again and led
into the captured town without further resistance. Colonel
Pearce sent a flag, demanding immediate and unconditional
surrender&mdash;and surrender it was, with the single stipulation
that private property should be respected. As soon as
practicable General Dearborn left the fleet for York, where
he was in command before night fell. His first dispatch to
the Secretary of War appears as follows in the text of Fay's
Collection, p. 81, and is substantially the same in Niles'
Register, IV. p. 178:</p>

<span class="i2">April 28, 1813.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>After a detention of some days by adverse winds, we arrived at this
place yesterday morning, and at eight o'clock commenced landing the
troops, about three miles westward from the town, and one mile and
a half from the enemy's works. The wind was high and in unfavorable
direction for the boats, which prevented the landing of the troops at
a clear field, the scite of the ancient French fort Toronto [RouillÃ©]. It
prevented, also, many of the armed vessels from taking positions which
would have most effectually covered our landing, but everything that
could be done was effected.</p>

<p>The riflemen under Major Forsyth first landed, under a heavy fire
from the Indians and other troops. General Sheaffe commanded in
person. He had collected his whole force in the woods near the point
where the wind compelled our troops to land. His force consisted of
700 regulars and militia, and 100 Indians. Major Forsyth was supported
as promptly as possible; but the contest was sharp and severe for nearly
half an hour, and the enemy were repulsed by a number far inferior to
theirs. As soon as General Pike landed with 700 or 800 men and the remainder
of the troops were pushing for the shore, the enemy retreated to
their works. Our troops were now formed on the ground originally intended
for their landing, advanced through a thick wood, and after carrying
one [the Western] battery by assault, were moving in columns toward
the main work; when within 60 rods of this, a tremendous explosion
took place from a magazine previously prepared, which threw out such
immense quantities of stone as most seriously to injure our troops.
I have not yet been able to collect the returns of the killed and
wounded; but our loss will I fear exceed 100 [see <a href="#Page_XCI">p. xci</a>
]; and among
those I have to lament the loss of that brave and excellent officer,
Brigadier-General Pike, who received a concussion from a large stone,
which terminated his valuable life within a few hours. His loss will be
severely felt.</p>

<p>Previously to this explosion the enemy had retired into the town,
excepting a party of regulars, to the number of 40, who did not escape
the effects of the shock....</p>

<p>General Sheaffe moved off with the regular troops and left the commanding
officer of the militia to make the best terms he could. In the
mean time all further resistance on the part of the enemy ceased, and the
outlines of a capitulation were agreed on....</p>

<p class="left45">I have the honor to be, Sir, &amp;c.,<br />

<p>General Pike's body was prepared at York and conveyed
to Sackett's Harbor for interment. It was first buried at
Fort Tompkins, at a little distance from the shiphouse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CIV" id="Page_CIV">civ</a></span>
together with that of his aid-de-camp, Captain Nicholson,<a name="FNanchor_M-34" id="FNanchor_M-34" href="#Footnote_M-34" class="fnanchor">[M-34]</a>
who had been mortally wounded by his side. Among the
defenses of Sackett's Harbor was one named Fort Pike,
which stood on Black River bay. A view of this work, as
it was in 1855, is given by Lossing. Madison Barracks was
built close by Fort Pike, soon after the war, and in the
burying-ground there were deposited the remains of several
officers, to whose memories a simple wooden monument
was erected in 1819. Lossing figures this, p. 617, as it
was when he examined it in July, 1855, "more leaning than
the Pisa tower." In 1860 it was rapidly crumbling into dust;
the urn which had surmounted it was gone, and the inscription
was illegible. A part of the legend on the west panel,
copied by Lossing at his previous visit, had been: "In
memory of Brigadier General Z. M. Pike, killed at York,
U. C. 27th April, 1813."</p>

<p>A tablet to the memory of General Pike has for many
years been set in St. Michael's church, at Trenton, N. J.
For a description of this object and a copy of the inscription
I am indebted to the courteous attentions of the rector,
Rev. O. S. Bunting. It consists of a marble slab, about 36
inches high by 20 inches wide, inserted in the outer wall of
the church on the east side, the base being about two feet
from the ground. On this slab is carved in relief an urn,
which occupies the whole surface, as nearly as the shape of
an urn can fill a rectangle; and on the urn is engraven the
following inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">
Sacred<br />
to the memory of<br />
GEN. Z. M. PIKE,<br />
of the U.Â S. Army,<br />
who fell in defence<br />
of his country<br />
on the 27th April<br />
A. D. 1813,<br />
at York<br />
Upper Canada.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CV" id="Page_CV">cv</a></span></p>

<p>On the base is inscribed: "This small tribute of respect
is erected by his friend, Z. R." The stone is in a good state
of preservation, and its position affords considerable security.
Mr. Bunting has no particulars of the erection of the
tablet, and does not identify "Z. R."</p>

<p>Upon the fall of York, the press of the whole country
teemed with jubilant notices of the auspicious event&mdash;the
first signal success of our arms after a period of defeat,
doubt, and almost despair. The death of Pike was on every
tongue, in terms of affection for the man and honor to his
name, coupled with expressions of horror and detestation of
the manner in which he and so many of his companions had
met their fate. The feeling in the latter regard was spontaneous
and natural under the circumstances&mdash;it appears
differently in the cold gray light of history. Among uncounted
tributes to Pike's memory, a few may be selected
for reproduction in the present biography.</p>

<p>The editor of Niles' Register was in the habit of dedicating
a completed volume. The fourth volume, from Mar.
to Sept., 1813, is inscribed: "In Testimony of Respect to
the Memory of <span class="smcap">Zebulon Montgomery Pike</span>, Brigadier-General:
who fell gloriously before York, in Upper Canada.
And <span class="smcap">James Lawrence</span>, Captain in the Navy: Killed on
board the Chesapeake frigate, fighting the Shannon. This
volume of the Weekly Register, is dedicated. The former
happily expired on the conquered flag of the foe, the latter
died exclaiming, 'Don't give up the ship.'"</p>

<p>The same volume prints the following tribute in No. 14,
for the week ending June 5th, 1813, pp. 228, 229:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It has been the lot of few men, unassisted by many adventitious circumstances
to acquire and possess that high confidence and respect of
all classes of his fellow-citizens, the late General Pike so happily enjoyed.
Without the splendor of achievement that surrounds the fortunate hero,
and commands the applause of the populace, the lamented man forced
his way into the public affection by the power of his virtues and
strength of his talents alone. Careless of popularity, a great and good
name was "buckled on him" by a discriminating people. He was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CVI" id="Page_CVI">cvi</a></span>
<i>Ã¦gis</i> of the army; and the soldiery looked upon him with admiration and
reverence; love, mixed with the fear of offending his nice ideas of right,
governing them all. He was a severe disciplinarian; but had the
felicity to make his soldiers assured that his strictness had for its object
their glory&mdash;their ease&mdash;their preservation and safety. With a mind
conscious of its own rectitude, he was not easily diverted from his
purpose; and difficulty only invigorated exertion. To all the sweetness
of a familiar friend, he added a strength of remark and pungency
of observation, that delighted all around him. Though the camp was
his delight, he was fitted for any company; and could make himself
agreeable on every proper occasion. His courage was invincible, for it
was the result of his reason; and his death is a proof of it. The pride
of his countrymen in arms, the pattern for a military life, he fell, at the
moment of victory, on the first opportunity that had been afforded to
reduce to practice the perfection of his theory&mdash;"but he fell like a man."
His transcendent qualities were opening to the view; but they were
nipped in the bud by the base stratagem of a beaten foe.<a name="FNanchor_M-35" id="FNanchor_M-35" href="#Footnote_M-35" class="fnanchor">[M-35]</a> His name is
unperishable; and will descend to posterity with the Warrens, Montgomerys
and Woosters, of the other war. Though dead, he shall yet
speak to the army of the United States. His scheme of tactics and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CVII" id="Page_CVII">cvii</a></span>
practice of discipline shall be the criterion of the soldier's worth. He
has left behind him many accomplished scholars, who, "while memory
holds her seat," shall teach his rules to others, and sacredly preserve
them as landmarks whereby to govern themselves. The labors of the
illustrious dead are not lost. His body has descended to the tomb, and
the gallant spirit taken its flight to Him that gave it&mdash;but his virtues shall
live, and be with us, many generations.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Niles' eulogy concludes with a dramatic incident
which commends itself for insertion here, in further illustration
of the strong hold General Pike acquired upon public
sentiment:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
It may not be amiss, perhaps, to notice a humble mark of respect
offered by the managers of the Baltimore theatre, a few evenings ago, to
the memory of the general. The house was crowded in consequence of
several spectacles designed in honor of the day (the review of the Baltimore
brigade). Between the second and third acts of the play the curtain
slowly, but unexpectedly, rose to solemn music, and exhibited
a lofty obelisk on which was inscribed "Z. M. Pike, Brigadier General&mdash;Fell
gloriously before York&mdash;March [April] 27, 1813." On the left hand
of the monument was that elegant actress, Mrs. Green, in character as
Columbia, armed, kneeling on one knee, and pensively pointing with her
spear to the name of the hero. Her dress was uncommonly splendid
and very appropriate to the idea [she] designed to sustain. On the other
side was a lady, an elegant figure, dressed in the deepest mourning,
gracefully leaning against the pedestal, immovably fixed, "in all the
solemn majesty of woe." The curtain being fairly raised, a death-like
silence for a considerable time reigned in the house, the music excepted;
which did not interrupt the pleasing melancholy by any ill-timed boisterousness:
but soon the feelings of the people burst forth in one unanimous
expression of applause, such has been rarely witnessed, certainly
never surpassed in any country, on a similar occasion.</p>
</div>

<p>In the House of Representatives of the national Congress,
on Tuesday, July 27th, 1813, the following resolution was
submitted by Mr. Nelson:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
<i>Resolved</i>, That a committee be appointed to examine and report on
the propriety of conferring public honors on the memory of James
Lawrence, late of the U. States frigate Chesapeake, and of Zebulon M.
Pike, late a brigadier-general in the armies of the U. States, whose distinguished
deaths in the service of their country add lustre to the character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CVIII" id="Page_CVIII">cviii</a></span>
of the American nation; the propriety of adopting, as the peculiar
children of the Republic, the sons of those distinguished heroes; and
the propriety of making provision for the support and comfort of the
families of these deceased officers.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the many measures which were adopted to
honor General Pike's name and fame, there is perhaps
none more marked than the action of the officers of
the regiment of which he was the colonel. We have a
glimpse of the hearts that still beat for him in the proceedings
recorded in the Register of May 14th, 1814, VI.
p. 176:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Burlington</span>, <i>April 29, 1814</i>.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the Board of Honor of the 15th, or Pike's regiment
held on the 24th inst., it was resolved, that the following articles of the
constitution governing said Board be carried into effect.&mdash;"Article 2d.
Each succeeding 27th April, the day on which the immortal Pike fell;
the standard will be dressed in mourning; each officer to wear crape,
and all unnecessary duties dispensed with during the day, as a token of
respect for our departed friend and commander," and that captain
Vandalsem, captain Barton, and lieutenant Goodwin be a committee of
arrangement for the day.<a name="FNanchor_M-36" id="FNanchor_M-36" href="#Footnote_M-36" class="fnanchor">[M-36]</a></p>

<p>Agreeably to the above resolution, the regiment formed at eleven
o'clock a. m. on the grand parade, and proceeded in funeral order
through town, to the court house square, and from thence through Pearl
street, to the cantonment, where by the request of the commanding
officer, lieutenant Goodwin delivered the following pertinent address:</p>

<p>Fellow soldiers&mdash;Thus far have we solemnized this day in commemoration
of the immortal father of our regiment, our beloved Pike. When
our political horizon was darkened by the confusion that pervaded the
whole world, he was among the first that advanced to meet our barbarous
and unjust enemy. Stimulated by a love of country, and a thirst
for glory, he solicited with ardor, the honor of facing the enemy's batteries
on all occasions, he panted to invade in the just cause of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CIX" id="Page_CIX">cix</a></span>
country, and lived with the lively hope of perpetuating our freedom and
handing it down unpolluted to future generations.</p>

<p>As an officer, the remotest corners of our country are filled with his
fame. Let the learned record his deeds, and let us improve the principles
he has left imprinted in our minds, and like him live but "for honor
and happiness in this life, and fame after death." Nor let us confound
him with the list of ordinary heroes. He will compare with [Joseph]
Warren and [Richard] Montgomery, for like them he fell at the head of
his column, bravely fighting in his country's cause.</p>

<p>With body shattered by an inhuman and unequalled explosion, he
smiled in death, while our flag waved triumphant in his sight, and
expired without regret, on a pillow purchased with his life.</p>

<p>May the omnipotent hand which directs all things, cause his spirit to
hover around our councils in the field, and at all times be with his beloved
regiment.</p>

<p>After which the regiment fired three vollies and retired to their
quarters.</p>

<p>Within some months, probably, of General Pike's death,
a man-of-war was named in his honor. The Register for
Aug. 7th, 1813, p. 374, describes it: "The <i>General Pike</i> is
a strong, stout, and well built vessel. Length on deck 140
feet, beam 37 feet, burthen about 900 tons&mdash;has 14 ports on
a side, and carries on the main deck long 24's&mdash;has also long
24's on the forecastle and poop, (one each), moving on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CX" id="Page_CX">cx</a></span>
circle, and four guns on her top gallant forecastle; in all
34 guns." General A. W. Greely, who interested himself to
procure the information, tells me that this frigate, a twin
ship with the <i>Madison</i>, was built in 63 days and launched on
Lake Ontario, at Sackett's Harbor, where she barely escaped
destruction by fire, owing to the mistaken zeal of an officer
who applied the torch, supposing the American victory to
be a defeat; and that it does not appear that the vessel was
ever brought into action.</p>

<p>I have already alluded to the Fort Pike on Lake Ontario.
There was another Fort Pike, the name of which still finds
place in current gazetteers. This was a military post on
Petites Coquilles island, in Orleans parish, Louisiana, 35
miles E. N. E. of New Orleans. While it is not probable
that all the counties, towns, etc., called "Pike" were named
for our hero, certainly most of them bear his own name,
alone or in combination or composition. There is a Pike
county in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,
Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
There are about 20 Pike townships in different counties of
Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Pike
is the name of several small places in Illinois, New York,
North Carolina, and Ohio. Pike City is a village in Sierra

Bledsoe Co., Tenn. Some of these places are no doubt
named for other persons of the same surname; some are
called for the pike, a fish, as is the case with several
Pike rivers, creeks, or ponds not included in the above
list; and some may refer to a turnpike road, or have yet
another implication.</p>

<p>To those of the foregoing geographical and political
names which commemorate our hero is to be added the
designation of "Pikes" as an epithet of the "Forty-niners"
and later emigrants who navigated the great plains with
their "prairie schooners." Thus Mr. Prentis, in the address
already cited, says, pp. 193, 194:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
To these people thus described, and to all who bore to them a family
resemblance, and who in 1849 and in subsequent years crossed the Plains
to California, came to be applied, by whom I know not, the general name of
"Pikes." Various explanations have been given of the origin of the name.
The most reasonable one is, that, there are in Missouri and Illinois two
large counties named Pike, and separated from each other by the
Mississippi river. In 1849 an immense emigration set in from these
counties to California. In consequence, the traveler bound for the States,
meeting teams, and asking the usual question, "Where are you from?"
was answered frequently with, "Pike county" meaning in some cases
one Pike county, in some cases the other. This led to the general
impression that everybody on the road was from Pike county, or that the
inhabitants of Pike had all taken the road. Hence the general name
of "Pikes," as applied to emigrants, especially to those traveling from
Missouri, and, generally, those migrating from southern Illinois and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CXII" id="Page_CXII">cxii</a></span>
southern Indiana. Thus the popular song&mdash;the only poetry I ever heard
of applied to this class of "movers," commences:</p>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"My name it is Joe Bowers,</p>
<p>I've got a brother Ike;</p>
<p>I'm bound for Californy,</p>
<p>And I'm all the way from Pike."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Pike County, Ill., and Pike County, Mo., are certainly
both named for the general, and I have no doubt that Mr.
Prentis' explanation of "Pikes" is correct. With the above
doggerel compare the slang phrase noted beyond, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Footnote_II-46">p. 454</a>,
and duly legended as the head-line of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_457">p. 457</a>.</p>

<p>Another curious word, to which Pike has given rise
indirectly, is "Peaker," as a designation of persons who
came to the vicinity of Pike's Peak. Thus, we read in
Colonel Meline's book, p. 89: "Most of the people who
have settled on these farms [between Colorado Springs and
Denver] were disappointed 'Peakers'&mdash;either those who had
thrown down the shovel to take up the plough, or those
who, with exhausted means, found a long mountain journey
still before them after they had reached the Peak."</p>

<p>There is a sameness about the many published portraits
of Pike which shows that they were probably all taken from
one original painting. Lossing's cut looks a little different
from the rest, as it faces the other way, but it is the same
picture reversed in copying, no doubt with the camera
lucida. There is no mistaking the extremely long, large
nose, above the full compressed lips, denoting the forceful
character which Pike displayed conspicuously throughout
his career, whether in leading a handful of men through
an unbroken wilderness, or in heading the columns which
assaulted an intrenched foe. The same uniform coat, with its
epaulets, its high standing, embroidered collar, unbuttoned
across the breast and the flap turned down on one side,
appears in all these likenesses. Such are inserted in some
of the editions of Pike's work; one of the reproductions
forms the frontispiece of an early popular history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_CXIII" id="Page_CXIII">cxiii</a></span>
war, and is called "a striking likeness" on the title page.
They are all doubtless traceable to the painting which has
long hung and still hangs in the historical gallery of Independence
Hall at Philadelphia, alongside the portraits of
Meriwether Lewis, William Clark, and many other noble
men who loved and lived for their country. The painting
which hangs in one of the rooms of the Minnesota Historical
Society at St. Paul is believed to be a copy of this,
though it differs in the introduction of a spirit hand, extended
from an invisible arm, holding a wreath over the
head&mdash;an attempt at symbolism in which the unknown
artist has not been very successful. This portrait is dim
and much cracked. I am informed by Mr. William M.
Maguire of Denver, that a prominent citizen of Colorado
has recently executed a bronze bust of Pike, to be placed in
Manitou. Facsimiles of Pike's signature are seldom seen
in print; Lossing gives one with the portrait on p. 586 of
his Field Book. I am not aware that any facsimile of a
letter in Pike's handwriting has hitherto been published.
That one which is given in the present volume was selected
from among many I have examined in the archives of the
War Department, both for its intrinsic historical interest,
and for the unusually well-formed signature it bears&mdash;that
of one who died, as he had lived, for his country&mdash;of one
whose fame that country will never permit to perish.

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">ITINERARY: ST. LOUIS TO ST. PAUL, AUGUST 9TH-SEPTEMBER
21ST, 1805.</span></h2>

<p>Sailed from my encampment, near St. Louis, at 4
p. m., on Friday, the 9th of August, 1805, with one sergeant,
two corporals, and 17 privates, in a keel-boat 70 feet
long, provisioned for four months. Water very rapid. Encamped
on the east side of the river, at the head of an
island.<a name="FNanchor_I-1" id="FNanchor_I-1" href="#Footnote_I-1" class="fnanchor">[I-1]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 10th.</i> Embarked early; breakfasted opposite the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
mouth of the Missouri, near Wood creek.<a name="FNanchor_I-2" id="FNanchor_I-2" href="#Footnote_I-2" class="fnanchor">[I-2]</a> About 5 p. m.
a storm came on from the westward; the boat lay-to. Having
gone out to march with two men behind a cluster of
islands, one of my soldiers swam a channel in the night, to
inform me that the boat had stopped during the storm. I
remained on the beach all night. Distance 28Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-3" id="FNanchor_I-3" href="#Footnote_I-3" class="fnanchor">[I-3]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 11th.</i> In the morning the boat came up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
stopped opposite the Portage De Sioux.<a name="FNanchor_I-4" id="FNanchor_I-4" href="#Footnote_I-4" class="fnanchor">[I-4]</a> We here spread
out our baggage to dry; discharged our guns at a target,
and scaled out our blunderbusses. Dined at the cave below
the Illinois, at the mouth of which river we remained some
time. From the course of the Mississippi, the Illinois<a name="FNanchor_I-5" id="FNanchor_I-5" href="#Footnote_I-5" class="fnanchor">[I-5]</a>
might be mistaken for a part of it. Encamped on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
lower point of an island,<a name="FNanchor_I-6" id="FNanchor_I-6" href="#Footnote_I-6" class="fnanchor">[I-6]</a> about six miles above the Illinois;
were much detained by passing the east side of some islands
above the Illinois; and were obliged to get into the water
and haul the boat through.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 12th.</i> In the morning made several miles to breakfast;
about 3 o'clock p. m. passed Buffaloe [Cuivre or Copper
river] or riviere au B&oelig;uf, about five miles above which
commences a beautiful cedar cliff. Having passed this, the
river expands to nearly two miles in width, and has four
islands, whose lowest points are nearly parallel; these we
called the Four Brothers. Encamped on the point of the
east one. It rained very hard all night. Caught one catfish.
Distance 29Â¾ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-7" id="FNanchor_I-7" href="#Footnote_I-7" class="fnanchor">[I-7]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 13th.</i> Late before we sailed; passed a vast number
of islands; left one of our dogs on shore; were much detained
by sand-bars, and obliged to haul our boat over several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
of them; observed several [Indian] encampments which
had been lately occupied. Rained all day. Distance 27
miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-8" id="FNanchor_I-8" href="#Footnote_I-8" class="fnanchor">[I-8]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 14th.</i> Hard rain in the morning; but a fine wind
springing up, we put off at half-past six o'clock. Passed a
camp of Sacs, consisting of three men with their families.
They were employed in spearing and scaffolding a fish,<a name="FNanchor_I-9" id="FNanchor_I-9" href="#Footnote_I-9" class="fnanchor">[I-9]</a>
about three feet in length, with a long flat snout; they
pointed out the channel, and prevented us from taking the
wrong one. I gave them a small quantity of whisky and
biscuit; and they, in return, presented me with some fish.
Sailed on through a continuation of islands for nearly 20
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
miles; met a young gentleman, Mr. Robedoux,<a name="FNanchor_I-10" id="FNanchor_I-10" href="#Footnote_I-10" class="fnanchor">[I-10]</a> by whom
I sent a letter to St. Louis; encamped on an island; caught
1,375 small fish. Rained all day. Distance 28 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-11" id="FNanchor_I-11" href="#Footnote_I-11" class="fnanchor">[I-11]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 15th.</i> Still raining in the morning. From the continued
series of wet weather, the men were quite galled
and sore. Met a Mr. Kettletas of N. Y., who gave me a line
to Mr. Fisher of the Prairie Des Chein [du Chien]. Passed
a small [elsewhere named Bar] river to the W., with a sand-bar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
at its entrance; also, passed Salt [elsewhere called
Oahahah] river, which I do not recollect having seen on
any chart; it is a considerable stream, and at high water is
navigable for at least 200 miles. Left another dog. Distance
26 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-12" id="FNanchor_I-12" href="#Footnote_I-12" class="fnanchor">[I-12]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 16th.</i> Embarked early, but were so unfortunate as
to get fast on a log; and did not extricate ourselves until
past eleven o'clock, having to saw off a log under the water.
At three o'clock arrived at the house of a Frenchman, situate
on the W. side of the river, opposite Hurricane island.
His cattle appeared to be in fine order, but his corn in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
bad state of cultivation. About one mile above his house,
on the W. shore, is a very handsome hill, which he informed
me was level on the top, with a gradual descent on either
side, and a fountain of fine water. This man likewise told
me that two men had been killed on the Big Bay, or Three
Brothers; and desired to be informed what measures had
been taken in consequence thereof. Caught three catfish
and one perch. Encamped four miles above the house.
Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-13" id="FNanchor_I-13" href="#Footnote_I-13" class="fnanchor">[I-13]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 17th.</i> Embarked and came on remarkably well; at
ten o'clock stopped for breakfast, and in order to arrange
our sail; when the wind served, we put off and continued
under easy sail all day. Passed three batteaux. Distance
39 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-14" id="FNanchor_I-14" href="#Footnote_I-14" class="fnanchor">[I-14]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10-12</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 18th.</i> Embarked early; about eleven
o'clock passed an Indian camp, on the E. side. They fired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
several guns; but we passed without stopping. Very hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
head winds part of the day. Caught six fish. Distance
23 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-15" id="FNanchor_I-15" href="#Footnote_I-15" class="fnanchor">[I-15]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 19th.</i> Embarked early and made fine way; but at
nine o'clock, in turning the point of a sand-bar, our boat
struck a sawyer. At the moment, we did not know it had
injured her; but, in a short time after, discovered her to be
sinking; however, by thrusting oakum into the leak and
bailing, we got her to shore on a bar, where, after entirely
unloading, we with great difficulty keeled her sufficiently to
cut out the plank and put in a new one. This at the time
I conceived to be a great misfortune; but upon examination
we discovered that the injury resulting from it was
greater than we were at first induced to believe; for upon
inspection we found our provisions and clothing considerably
damaged. The day was usefully and necessarily
employed in assorting, sunning, and airing those articles.
One of my hunters, Sparks, having gone on shore to hunt,
swam the river about seven miles above and killed a deer;
but finding we did not come, he returned down the river,
and joined us by swimming. Whilst we were at work at
our boat on the sand-beach, three canoes with Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
passed on the opposite shore. They cried, "How-do-you-do?"
wishing us to give them an invitation to come over;
but receiving no answer they passed on. We then put our
baggage on board and put off, designing to go where the
young man had killed the deer; but after dark we became
entangled among the sand-bars, and were obliged to stop
and encamp on the point of a beach. Caught two fish.
Distance 14 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-16" id="FNanchor_I-16" href="#Footnote_I-16" class="fnanchor">[I-16]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 20th.</i> Arrived at the foot of the rapids De Moyen<a name="FNanchor_I-17" id="FNanchor_I-17" href="#Footnote_I-17" class="fnanchor">[I-17]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
at seven o'clock. Although no soul on board had passed
them, we commenced ascending them immediately. Our
boat being large and moderately loaded, we found great difficulty.
The river all the way through is from three-quarters
to a mile wide. The rapids are 11 miles long, with
successive ridges and shoals extending from shore to shore.
The first has the greatest fall and is the most difficult to
ascend. The channel, a bad one, is on the east side in passing
the two first bars; then passes under the edge of the
third; crosses to the west, and ascends on that side, all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
way to the Sac village. The shoals continue the whole distance.
We had passed the first and most difficult shoal,
when we were met by Mr. Wm. Ewing,<a name="FNanchor_I-18" id="FNanchor_I-18" href="#Footnote_I-18" class="fnanchor">[I-18]</a> who I understand
is an agent appointed to reside with the Sacs to teach them
the science of agriculture, with a French interpreter, four
chiefs and 15 men of the Sac nation, in their canoes, bearing
a flag of the United States. They came down to assist
me up the rapids; took out 14 of my heaviest barrels, and
put two of their men in the barge to pilot us up. Arrived
at the house of Mr. Ewing, opposite the village, at dusk.
The land on both sides of the rapids is hilly, but a rich soil.
Distance 16 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-19" id="FNanchor_I-19" href="#Footnote_I-19" class="fnanchor">[I-19]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 21st.</i> All the chief men of the village came over
to my encampment, where I spoke to them to the following
purport:</p>

<p>"That their great father, the president of the United
States, wishing to be more intimately acquainted with the
situation, wants, &amp;c., of the different nations of the red
people, in our newly acquired territory of Louisiana, had
ordered the general to send a number of his young warriors
in different directions, to take them by the hand, and make
such inquiries as might afford the satisfaction required.</p>

<p>"That I was authorized to choose situations for their
trading establishments; and wished them to inform me if
that place would be considered by them as central.</p>

<p>"That I was sorry to hear of the murder which had been
committed on the river below; but, in consideration of
their assurances that it was none of their nation, and the
anxiety exhibited by them on the occasion, I had written
to the general and informed him of what they had said on
the subject.</p>

<p>"That in their treaty they engaged to apprehend all
traders who came among them without license; for that
time, I could not examine their traders on this subject; but
that, on my return, I would make a particular examination.</p>

<p>"That if they thought proper they might send a young
man in my boat, to inform the other villages of my
mission," etc.</p>

<p>I then presented them with some tobacco, knives, and
whisky. They replied to the following purport:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"That they thanked me for the good opinion I had of
their nation, and for what I had written the general. That
themselves, their young warriors, and the whole nation,
were glad to see me among them.</p>

<p>"That as for the situation of the trading-houses, they
could not determine, being but a part of the nation. With
respect to sending a young man along, that if I would wait
until to-morrow, they would choose one out. And finally,
that they thanked me for my tobacco, knives, and whisky."</p>

<p>Not wishing to lose any time, after writing to the
general<a name="FNanchor_I-20" id="FNanchor_I-20" href="#Footnote_I-20" class="fnanchor">[I-20]</a> and my friends, I embarked and made six miles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
above the village. Encamped on a sand-bar. One canoe
of savages passed.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 22d.</i> Embarked at 5 o'clock a. m. Hard head
winds. Passed a great number of islands. The river very
wide and full of sand-bars. Distance 23 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-21" id="FNanchor_I-21" href="#Footnote_I-21" class="fnanchor">[I-21]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 23d.</i> Cool morning. Came on 5Â¼ miles, where,
on the west shore, there is a very handsome situation for
a garrison. The channel of the river passes under the hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
which is about 60 feet perpendicular, and level on the top;
400 yards in the rear there is a small prairie of 8 or 10 acres,
which would be a convenient spot for gardens; and on the
east side of the river there is a beautiful prospect over
a large prairie, as far as the eye can extend, now and then
interrupted by groves of trees. Directly under the rock is
a limestone spring, which, after an hour's work, would afford
water amply sufficient for the consumption of a regiment.
The landing is bold and safe, and at the lower part of the
hill a road may be made for a team in half an hour. Black
and white oak timber in abundance. The mountain continues
about two miles, and has five springs bursting from
it in that distance.</p>

<p>Met four Indians and two squaws; landed with them;
gave them one quart of <i>made</i> whisky [<i>i. e.</i>, about three-fourths
water], a few biscuit, and some salt. I requested
some venison of them; they pretended they could not
understand me; but after we had left them they held up
two hams, and hallooed and laughed at us in derision.
Passed nine horses on shore, and saw many signs of Indians.
Passed a handsome prairie on the east side, and encamped
at its head.<a name="FNanchor_I-22" id="FNanchor_I-22" href="#Footnote_I-22" class="fnanchor">[I-22]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>Three batteaux from Michilimackinac stopped at our
camp. We were told they were the property of Mr. Myers
Michals. We were also informed that the largest Sac village
was about 2Â½ miles out on the prairie; and that this
prairie was called halfway from St. Louis to the prairie Des
Cheins.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 24th.</i> In the morning passed a number of islands.
Before dinner, Corporal Bradley and myself took our guns
and went on shore; we got behind a savannah, by following
a stream we conceived to have been a branch of the river,
but which led us at least two leagues from it.<a name="FNanchor_I-23" id="FNanchor_I-23" href="#Footnote_I-23" class="fnanchor">[I-23]</a> My two
favorite dogs, having gone out with us, gave out in the
prairie, owing to the heat, high grass, and want of water;
but, thinking they would come on, we continued our march.
We heard the report of a gun, and supposing it to be from
our boat, answered it; shortly after, however, we passed an
Indian trail, which appeared as if the persons had been
hurried, I presume at the report of our guns; for with this
people all strangers are enemies. Shortly after we struck
the river, and the boat appeared in view; stayed some time
for my dogs; two of my men volunteered to go in search of
them. Encamped on the west shore, nearly opposite a
chalk bank. My two men had not yet returned, and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
extraordinary, as they knew my boat never waited for any
person on shore. They endeavored to strike the Mississippi
ahead of us. We fired a blunderbuss at three different
times, to let them know where we lay. Distance 23Â½
miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-24" id="FNanchor_I-24" href="#Footnote_I-24" class="fnanchor">[I-24]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Aug. 25th.</i> Stopped on the Sand-bank prairie
on the E. side [about New Boston, Ill.], from which you
have a beautiful prospect of at least 40 miles down the river,
bearing S. 38Â° E. Discovered that our boat leaked very
fast; but we secured her inside so completely with oakum
and tallow as nearly to prevent the leak. Fired a blunderbuss
every hour, all day, as signals for our men. Passed the
river Iowa. Encamped at night on the prairie marked
Grant's prairie [below Muscatine, Ia.]. The men had not
yet arrived. Distance 28 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-25" id="FNanchor_I-25" href="#Footnote_I-25" class="fnanchor">[I-25]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 26th.</i> Rain, with a very hard head wind. Towed
our boat about nine miles, to where the river Hills join
the Mississippi. Here I expected to find the two men I
had lost, but was disappointed. The mercury in Reamur
[RÃ©aumur] at 13Â°; whereas yesterday it was 26Â° [= 61Â¼ and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
90Â½ Fahr.] Met two peroques [<i>sic</i><a name="FNanchor_I-26" id="FNanchor_I-26" href="#Footnote_I-26" class="fnanchor">[I-26]</a>] full of Indians, who
commenced hollowing [hallooing] "How do you do?" etc.
They then put to shore and beckoned us to do likewise,
but we continued our course. This day very severe on the
men. Distance 28Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-27" id="FNanchor_I-27" href="#Footnote_I-27" class="fnanchor">[I-27]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 27th.</i> Embarked early; cold north wind; mercury
10Â°; the wind so hard ahead that we were obliged to tow
the boat all day. Passed one peroque of Indians; also, the
Riviere De Roche [Rock river], late in the day. Some
Indians, who were encamped there, embarked in their
canoes and ascended the river before us. The wind was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
very strong that, although it was down the stream, they
were near sinking. Encamped about four miles above the
Riviere De Roche, on the W. shore. This day passed
a pole on a prairie on which five dogs were hanging.
Distance 22 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-28" id="FNanchor_I-28" href="#Footnote_I-28" class="fnanchor">[I-28]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 28th.</i> About an hour after we had embarked, we
arrived at the camp of Mr. James Aird,<a name="FNanchor_I-29" id="FNanchor_I-29" href="#Footnote_I-29" class="fnanchor">[I-29]</a> a Scotch gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
of Michilimackinac. He had encamped, with some
goods, on the beach, and was repairing his boat, which had
been injured in crossing [descending] the rapids of the
Riviere De Roche, at the foot of which we now were. He
had sent three boats back for the goods left behind. Breakfasted
with him and obtained considerable information.
Commenced ascending the rapids. Carried away our rudder
in the first rapid; but after getting it repaired, the wind
raised and we hoisted sail. Although entire strangers, we
sailed through them with a perfect gale blowing all the
time; had we struck a rock, in all probability we would
have bilged and sunk. But we were so fortunate as to pass
without touching. Met Mr. Aird's boats, which had pilots,
fast on the rocks. Those shoals are a continued chain of
rocks, extending in some places from shore to shore, about
18 miles in length.<a name="FNanchor_I-30" id="FNanchor_I-30" href="#Footnote_I-30" class="fnanchor">[I-30]</a> They afford more water than those of
De Moyen, but are much more rapid.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 29th.</i> Breakfasted at the Reynard village, above

the rapids; this is the first village of the Reynards.<a name="FNanchor_I-31" id="FNanchor_I-31" href="#Footnote_I-31" class="fnanchor">[I-31]</a> I expected
to find my two men here, but was disappointed.
Finding they had not passed, I lay by until four o'clock,
the wind fair all the time. The chief informed me, by
signs, that in four days they could march to Prairie Des
Cheins; and promised to furnish them with mockinsons
[moccasins], and put them on their route. Set sail and
made at least four knots an hour. I was disposed to
sail all night; but the wind lulling, we encamped on
the point of an island, on the W. shore. Distance 20
miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-32" id="FNanchor_I-32" href="#Footnote_I-32" class="fnanchor">[I-32]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 30th.</i> Embarked at five o'clock; wind fair, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
not very high. Sailed all day. Passed four peroques of
Indians. Distance 43 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-33" id="FNanchor_I-33" href="#Footnote_I-33" class="fnanchor">[I-33]</a></p>

<p><i>Aug. 31st.</i> Embarked early. Passed one peroque of
Indians; also, two encampments, one on a beautiful eminence
on the W. side of the river. This place had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
appearance of an old town. Sailed almost all day.
Distance 31Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-34" id="FNanchor_I-34" href="#Footnote_I-34" class="fnanchor">[I-34]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 1st.</i> Embarked early; wind fair; arrived
at the lead mines [Dubuque, Ia.] at twelve o'clock. A
dysentery, with which I had been afflicted several days,
was suddenly checked this morning, which I believe to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
been the occasion of a very violent attack of fever about
eleven o'clock. Notwithstanding it was very severe, I
dressed myself, with an intention to execute the orders of
the general relative to this place. We were saluted with
a field-piece, and received with every mark of attention by
Monsieur [Julien] Dubuque, the proprietor. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
no horses at the house, and it was six miles to where the
mines were worked; it was therefore impossible to make
a report by actual inspection. I therefore proposed 10
queries, on the answers to which my report was founded.<a name="FNanchor_I-35" id="FNanchor_I-35" href="#Footnote_I-35" class="fnanchor">[I-35]</a></p>

<p>Dined with Mr. D., who informed me that the Sioux and
Sauteurs<a name="FNanchor_I-36" id="FNanchor_I-36" href="#Footnote_I-36" class="fnanchor">[I-36]</a> were as warmly engaged in opposition as ever;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
that not long since the former killed 15 Sauteurs, who on the
10th of August in return killed 10 Sioux, at the entrance of
the St. Peters [Minnesota river]; and that a war-party, composed
of Sacs, Reynards, and Puants [Winnebagoes<a name="FNanchor_I-37" id="FNanchor_I-37" href="#Footnote_I-37" class="fnanchor">[I-37]</a>], of
200 warriors, had embarked on an expedition against the
Sauteurs; but that they had heard that the chief, having
had an unfavorable dream, persuaded the party to return,
and that I would meet them on my voyage. At this place
I was introduced to a chief called Raven, of the Reynards.
He made a very flowery speech on the occasion, which I
answered in a few words, accompanied by a small present.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>I had now given up all hopes of my two men, and was
about to embark when a peroque arrived, in which they
were, with a Mr. Blondeau, and two Indians whom that gentleman
had engaged above the rapids of Stony [Rock] river.
The two soldiers had been six days without anything to eat
except muscles [mussels], when they met Mr. James Aird,
by whose humanity and attention their strength and spirits
were in a measure restored; and they were enabled to reach
the Reynard village, where they met Mr. B. The Indian
chief furnished them with corn and shoes, and showed his
friendship by every possible attention. I immediately discharged
the hire of the Indians, and gave Mr. Blondeau a
passage to the Prairie des Cheins. Left the lead mines at
four o'clock. Distance 25 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-38" id="FNanchor_I-38" href="#Footnote_I-38" class="fnanchor">[I-38]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 2d.</i> After making two short reaches, we commenced
one which is 30 miles in length; the wind serving,
we just made it, and encamped on the E. side [near Cassville,
Wis.], opposite the mouth of Turkey river. In the course of
the day we landed to shoot pigeons. The moment a gun
was fired, some Indians, who were on the shore above us,
ran down and put off in their peroques with great precipitation;
upon which Mr. Blondeau informed me that all the
women and children were frightened at the very name of an
American boat, and that the men held us in great respect,
conceiving us very quarrelsome, much for war, and also very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
brave. This information I used as prudence suggested.
We stopped at an encampment about three miles below the
town, where they gave us some excellent plums. They
dispatched a peroque to the village, to give notice, as I supposed,
of our arrival. It commenced raining about dusk,
and rained all night. Distance 40 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-39" id="FNanchor_I-39" href="#Footnote_I-39" class="fnanchor">[I-39]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 3d.</i> Embarked at a pretty early hour. Cloudy.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Met two peroques of family Indians; they at first asked
Mr. Blondeau "if we were for war, or if going to war?" I
now experienced the good effect of having some person on
board who could speak their language; for they presented
me with three pair of ducks and a quantity of venison,
sufficient for all our crew for one day; in return, I made
them some trifling presents. Afterward met two peroques,
carrying some of the warriors spoken of on the 2d inst.
They kept at a great distance, until spoken to by Mr. B.,
when they informed him that their party had proceeded up
as high as Lake Pepin without effecting anything. It is
surprising what a dread the Indians in this quarter have of
the Americans. I have often seen them go round islands
to avoid meeting my boat. It appears to me evident that
the traders have taken great pains to impress upon the
minds of the savages the idea of our being a very vindictive,
ferocious, and warlike people. This impression was perhaps
made with no good intention; but when they find that our
conduct toward them is guided by magnanimity and justice,
instead of operating in an injurious manner, it will have the
effect to make them reverence at the same time they fear
us. Distance 25 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-40" id="FNanchor_I-40" href="#Footnote_I-40" class="fnanchor">[I-40]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 4th.</i> Breakfasted just below the Ouiscousing [Wisconsin
river<a name="FNanchor_I-41" id="FNanchor_I-41" href="#Footnote_I-41" class="fnanchor">[I-41]</a>]. Arrived at the Prairie des Cheins about
eleven o'clock; took quarters at Captain Fisher's, and were
politely received by him and Mr. Frazer.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 5th.</i> Embarked about half-past ten o'clock in a
Schenectady boat, to go to the mouth of the Ouiscousing,
in order to take the latitude [which I found to be 43Â° 28Â´ 8Â´Â´
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
N.], and look at the situation of the adjacent hills for a
post. Was accompanied by Judge Fisher, Mr. Frazer, and
Mr. Woods. We ascended the hill<a name="FNanchor_I-42" id="FNanchor_I-42" href="#Footnote_I-42" class="fnanchor">[I-42]</a> on the west side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Mississippi, and made choice of a spot which I thought
most eligible, being level on the top, having a spring in the
rear, and commanding a view of the country around. A
shower of rain came on which completely wet us, and we
returned to the village without having ascended the Ouiscousing
as we intended. Marked four trees with A. B. C.
D., and squared the sides of one in the center. Wrote to
the general.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 6th.</i> Had a small council with the Puants, and a
chief of the lower band of the Sioux. Visited and laid out
a position for a post, on a hill called the Petit Gris [GrÃ¨s],<a name="FNanchor_I-43" id="FNanchor_I-43" href="#Footnote_I-43" class="fnanchor">[I-43]</a>
on the Ouiscousing, three miles above its mouth. Mr.
Fisher, who accompanied me, was taken very sick, in consequence
of drinking some water out of the Ouiscousing,
The Puants never have any white interpreters, nor have the
Fols Avoin [Folle Avoine (Menominee)<a name="FNanchor_I-44" id="FNanchor_I-44" href="#Footnote_I-44" class="fnanchor">[I-44]</a>] nation. In my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
council I spoke to a Frenchman and he to a Sioux, who
interpreted to some of the Puants.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 7th.</i> My men beat all the villagers jumping and
hopping. Began to load my new boats.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 8th.</i> Embarked at half-past eleven o'clock in two
batteaux. The wind fair and fresh. I found myself very
much embarrassed and cramped in my new boats, with provision
and baggage. I embarked two interpreters, one to
perform the whole voyage, whose name was Pierre Rosseau
[Rousseau<a name="FNanchor_I-45" id="FNanchor_I-45" href="#Footnote_I-45" class="fnanchor">[I-45]</a>]; and the other named Joseph Reinulle [Reinville<a name="FNanchor_I-46" id="FNanchor_I-46" href="#Footnote_I-46" class="fnanchor">[I-46]</a>],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
paid by Mr. Frazer to accompany me as high as the
falls of St. Anthony. Mr. Frazer<a name="FNanchor_I-47" id="FNanchor_I-47" href="#Footnote_I-47" class="fnanchor">[I-47]</a> is a young gentleman,
clerk to Mr. Blakely of Montreal; he was born in Vermont,
but has latterly resided in Canada. To the attention of this
gentleman I am much indebted; he procured for me everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
in his power that I stood in need of, dispatched his
bark canoes, and remained himself to go on with me. His
design was to winter with some of the Sioux bands. We
sailed well, came 18 miles, and encamped on the W. bank.<a name="FNanchor_I-48" id="FNanchor_I-48" href="#Footnote_I-48" class="fnanchor">[I-48]</a></p>

<p>I must not omit here to bear testimony to the politeness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
of all the principal inhabitants of the village. There is,
however, a material distinction to be made in the nature of
those attentions: The kindness of Messrs. Fisher, Frazer,
and Woods, all Americans, seemed to be the spontaneous
effusions of good will, and partiality to their countrymen;
it extended to the accommodation, convenience, exercises,
and pastimes of my men; and whenever they proved superior
to the French, openly showed their pleasure. But the
French Canadians appeared attentive rather from their natural
good manners than sincere friendship; however, it produced
from them the same effect that natural good will did
in the others.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 9th.</i> Embarked early. Dined at Cape Garlic, or at
Garlic river; after which we came on to an island on the E.
side, about five miles below the river [Upper] Iowa, and encamped.
Rained before sunset. Distance 28 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-49" id="FNanchor_I-49" href="#Footnote_I-49" class="fnanchor">[I-49]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 10th.</i> Rain still continuing, we remained at our
camp. Having shot at some pigeons, the report was heard
at the Sioux lodges, the same to whom I spoke on the 6th
at the Prairie [du Chien]; when La Fieulle [Feuille<a name="FNanchor_I-50" id="FNanchor_I-50" href="#Footnote_I-50" class="fnanchor">[I-50]</a>] sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
down six of his young men to inform me "that he had
waited three days with meat, etc., but that last night they
had began to drink, and that on the next day he would
receive me with his people sober." I returned him for
answer "that the season was advanced, time was pressing,
and if the rain ceased I must go on." Mr. Frazer
and the interpreter went home with the Indians. We
embarked about one o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_I-51" id="FNanchor_I-51" href="#Footnote_I-51" class="fnanchor">[I-51]</a> Frazer, returning, informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
me that the chief acquiesced in my reasons for pressing
forward, but that he had prepared a pipe (by way of letter)
to present me, to show to all the Sioux above, with a
message to inform them that I was a chief of their new
fathers, and that he wished me to be treated with friendship
and respect.</p>

<p>On our arrival opposite the lodges, the men were paraded
on the bank, with their guns in their hands. They saluted
us with ball with what might be termed three rounds;
which I returned with three rounds from each boat with my
blunderbusses. This salute, although nothing to soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
accustomed to fire, would not be so agreeable to many
people; as the Indians had all been drinking, and as some
of them even tried their dexterity, to see how near the boat
they could strike. They may, indeed, be said to have struck
on every side of us. When landed, I had my pistols in my
belt and sword in hand. I was met on the bank by the
chief, and invited to his lodge. As soon as my guards were
formed and sentinels posted, I accompanied him. Some of
my men who were going up with me I caused to leave
their arms behind, as a mark of confidence. At the chief's
lodge I found a clean mat and pillow for me to sit on, and
the before-mentioned pipe on a pair of small crutches before
me. The chief sat on my right hand, my interpreter and
Mr. Frazer on my left. After smoking, the chief spoke to
the following purport:</p>

<p>"That, notwithstanding he had seen me at the Prairie
[du Chien], he was happy to take me by the hand among
his own people, and there show his young men the respect
due to their new father [President Jefferson]. That, when
at St. Louis in the spring, his father [General Wilkinson]
had told him that if he looked down the river he would see
one of his young warriors [Pike] coming up. He now found
it true, and he was happy to see me, who knew the Great
Spirit was the father of all, both the white and the red
people; and if one died, the other could not live long.
That he had never been at war with their new father, and
hoped always to preserve the same understanding that now
existed. That he now presented me with a pipe, to show to
the upper bands as a token of our good understanding, and
that they might see his work and imitate his conduct.
That he had gone to St. Louis on a shameful visit, to carry
a murderer; but that we had given the man his life, and
he thanked us for it. That he had provided something to
eat, but he supposed I could not eat it; and if not, to give
it to my young men."</p>

<p>I replied: "That, although I had told him at the Prairie
my business up the Mississippi, I would again relate it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
him." I then mentioned the different objects I had in view
with regard to the savages who had fallen under our protection
by our late purchase from the Spaniards; the different
posts to be established; the objects of these posts as related
to them; supplying them with necessaries; having officers
and agents of government near them to attend to their business;
and above all to endeavor to make peace between
the Sioux and Sauteurs. "That it was possible on my
return I should bring some of the Sauteurs down with me,
and take with me some of the Sioux chiefs to St. Louis,
there to settle the long and bloody war which had existed
between the two nations. That I accepted his pipe with
pleasure, as the gift of a great man, the chief of four bands,
and a brother; that it should be used as he desired." I
then eat of the dinner he had provided, which was very
grateful. It was wild rye [rice?] and venison, of which I
sent four bowls to my men.</p>

<p>I afterward went to a dance, the performance of which
was attended with many curious maneuvers. Men and
women danced indiscriminately. They were all dressed in
the gayest manner; each had in the hand a small skin of
some description, and would frequently run up, point their
skin, and give a puff with their breath; when the person
blown at, whether man or woman, would fall, and appear
to be almost lifeless, or in great agony; but would recover
slowly, rise, and join in the dance. This they called their great
medicine; or, as I understood the word, dance of religion,
the Indians believing that they actually puffed something
into each others' bodies which occasioned the falling, etc.
It is not every person who is admitted; persons wishing to
join them must first make valuable presents to the society
to the amount of $40 or $50, give a feast, and then be
admitted with great ceremony. Mr. Frazer informed me
that he was once in the lodge with some young men who did
not belong to the club; when one of the dancers came in
they immediately threw their blankets over him, and forced
him out of the lodge; he laughed, but the young Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
called him a fool, and said "he did not know what the
dancer might blow into his body."</p>

<p>I returned to my boat; sent for the chief and presented
him with two carrots of tobacco, four knives, half a pound
of vermilion, and one quart of salt. Mr. Frazer asked
liberty to present them some rum; we made them up a keg
between us, of eight gallons&mdash;two gallons of whisky [the
rest water]. Mr. Frazer informed the chief that he dare not
give them any without my permission. The chief thanked
me for all my presents, and said "they must come free, as
he did not ask for them." I replied that "to those who
did not ask for anything, I gave freely; but to those who
asked for much, I gave only a little or none."</p>

<p>We embarked about half-past three o'clock; came three
miles, and encamped on the W. side.<a name="FNanchor_I-52" id="FNanchor_I-52" href="#Footnote_I-52" class="fnanchor">[I-52]</a> Mr. Frazer we left
behind, but he came up with his two peroques about dusk.
It commenced raining very hard. In the night a peroque
arrived from the lodges at his camp. During our stay at
their camp, there were soldiers appointed to keep the crowd
from my boats, who executed their duty with vigilance and
rigor, driving men, women, and children back, whenever
they came near my boats. At my departure, their soldiers
said, "As I had shaken hands with their chief, they must
shake hands with my soldiers." In which request I willingly
indulged them.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 11th.</i> Embarked at seven o'clock, although raining.
Mr. Frazer's canoes also came on until nine o'clock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Stopped for breakfast and made a fire. Mr. Frazer stayed
with me; finding his peroques not quite able to keep up, he
dispatched them. We embarked; came on until near six
o'clock, and encamped on the W. side. Saw nothing of his
peroques after they left us. Supposed to have come 16
miles this day.<a name="FNanchor_I-53" id="FNanchor_I-53" href="#Footnote_I-53" class="fnanchor">[I-53]</a> Rain and cold winds, all day ahead. The
river has never been clear of islands since I left Prairie Des
Chein. I absolutely believe it to be here two miles wide.
Hills, or rather prairie knobs, on both sides.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 12th.</i> It raining very hard in the morning, we did
not embark until ten o'clock, Mr. Frazer's peroques then
coming up. It was still raining, and was very cold; passed
the Racine<a name="FNanchor_I-54" id="FNanchor_I-54" href="#Footnote_I-54" class="fnanchor">[I-54]</a> river; also a prairie called Le Cross [La Crosse],
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
from a game of ball played frequently on it by the Sioux
Indians. This prairie is very handsome; it has a small
square hill, similar to some mentioned by Carver. It is
bounded in the rear by hills similar to [those of] the Prairie
Des Chein.</p>

<p>On this prairie Mr. Frazer showed me some holes dug
by the Sioux, when in expectation of an attack, into which
they first put their women and children, and then crawl
themselves. They were generally round and about 10 feet
in diameter; but some were half-moons and quite a breastwork.
This I understood was the chief work, which was
the principal redoubt. Their modes of constructing them
are: the moment they apprehend or discover an enemy
on the prairie, they commence digging with their knives,
tomahawks, and a wooden ladle; and in an incredibly short
space of time they have a hole sufficiently deep to cover
themselves and their families from the balls or arrows of the
enemy. They [enemies] have no idea of taking those subterraneous
redoubts by storm, as they would probably lose
a great number of men in the attack; and although they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
might be successful in the event, it would be considered
a very imprudent action.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer, finding his canoes not able to keep up, stayed
at this prairie to organize one of them, intending then to
overtake us. Came on three miles further.<a name="FNanchor_I-55" id="FNanchor_I-55" href="#Footnote_I-55" class="fnanchor">[I-55]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 13th.</i> Embarked at six o'clock. Came on to a
sand-bar, and stopped to dry my things. At this place Mr.
Frazer overtook me. We remained here three hours; came
on to the foot of the hills, at le Montaigne qui Trompe a
l'Eau [<i>sic</i>], which is a hill situated on the river. Rain all
day, except about two hours at noon. Passed Black river.
Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-56" id="FNanchor_I-56" href="#Footnote_I-56" class="fnanchor">[I-56]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 14th.</i> Embarked early; the fog so thick we could
not distinguish objects 20 yards. When we breakfasted we
saw nothing of Mr. Frazer's canoes. After breakfast, at
the head of an island, met Frazer's boats. Wind coming on
fair, we hoisted sail, and found that we were more on an
equality with our sails than our oars. The birch canoes
sailed very well, but we were able to outrow them. Met
the remainder of the war-party of the Sacs and Reynards
before noted, returning from their expedition against the
Sauteurs. I directed my interpreter to ask "How many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
scalps they had taken?" They replied, "None." He
added, "They were all squaws"; for which I reprimanded
him. Passed the mountain which stands in the river; or, as
the French term it, which soaks in the river. Came to the
Prairie Le Aisle [<i>sic</i><a name="FNanchor_I-57" id="FNanchor_I-57" href="#Footnote_I-57" class="fnanchor">[I-57]</a>], on the west.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer, Bradley, Sparks, and myself, went out to
hunt. We crossed first a dry flat prairie; when we arrived
at the hills we ascended them, from which we had a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
sublime and beautiful prospect. On the right, we saw the
mountains which we passed in the morning and the prairie
in their rear; like distant clouds, the mountains at the
Prairie Le Cross; on our left and under our feet, the valley
between the two barren hills through which the Mississippi
wound itself by numerous channels, forming many beautiful
islands, as far as the eye could embrace the scene; and our
four boats under full sail, their flags streaming before the
wind. It was altogether a prospect so variegated and
romantic that a man may scarcely expect to enjoy such
a one but twice or thrice in the course of his life. I proposed
keeping the hills until they led to the river, encamping
and waiting the next day for our boats; but Mr.
Frazer's anxiety to get to the boats induced me to yield.
After crossing a very thick bottom, fording and swimming
three branches of the river, and crossing several morasses,
we at twelve o'clock arrived opposite our boats, which were
encamped on the east side. We were brought over. Saw
great sign of elk, but had not the good fortune to come
across any of them. My men saw three on the shore.
Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-58" id="FNanchor_I-58" href="#Footnote_I-58" class="fnanchor">[I-58]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 15th.</i> Embarked early. Passed the riviere
Embarrass [Zumbro river], and Lean Clare [<i>i. e.</i>, l'Eau
Claire; Clear, White Water, or Minneiska river], on the W.,
which is navigable 135 miles. Encamped opposite the river
Le B&oelig;uf [Beef or Buffalo river], on the W. shore.<a name="FNanchor_I-59" id="FNanchor_I-59" href="#Footnote_I-59" class="fnanchor">[I-59]</a> At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57-58</a></span>
head of this river the Chipeways inhabit, and it is navigable
for peroques 40 or 50 leagues. Rained in the afternoon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
Mr. Frazer broke one of his canoes. Came about three
miles further than him. Distance 25 miles.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 16th.</i> Embarked late, as I wished Mr. Frazer to
overtake me, but came on very well. His canoes overtook
us at dinner, at the grand encampment [7Â½ miles<a name="FNanchor_I-60" id="FNanchor_I-60" href="#Footnote_I-60" class="fnanchor">[I-60]</a>] below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Lake Pepin. We made the sandy peninsula on the east at
the entrance of Lake Pepin, by dusk; passed the Sauteaux
[Chippewa<a name="FNanchor_I-61" id="FNanchor_I-61" href="#Footnote_I-61" class="fnanchor">[I-61]</a>] river on the east, at the entrance of the lake.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
After supper, the wind being fair, we put off with the intention
to sail across; my interpreter, Rosseau, telling me
that he had passed the lake twenty times, but never once in
the day; giving as a reason that the wind frequently rose
and detained them by day in the lake. But I believe the
traders' true reason generally is their fears of the Sauteurs,
as these have made several strokes of war at the mouth of
this river, never distinguishing between the Sioux and their
traders. However, the wind serving, I was induced to go
on; and accordingly we sailed, my boat bringing up the
rear, for I had put the sail of my big boat on my batteau,
and a mast of 22 feet. Mr. Frazer embarked on my boat.
At first the breeze was very gentle, and we sailed with our
violins and other music playing; but the sky afterward
became cloudy and quite a gale arose. My boat plowed
the swells, sometimes almost bow under. When we came
to the Traverse [crossing-place], which is opposite Point De
Sable [Sandy point], we thought it most advisable, the lake
being very much disturbed and the gale increasing, to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
harbor in a bay on the east. One of the canoes and my
boat came in very well together; but having made a fire
on the point to give notice to our boats in the rear, they
both ran on the bar before they doubled it, and were near
foundering; but by jumping into the lake we brought them
into a safe harbor. Distance 40 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-62" id="FNanchor_I-62" href="#Footnote_I-62" class="fnanchor">[I-62]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 17th.</i> Although there was every appearance of a
very severe storm, we embarked at half-past six o'clock, the
wind fair; but before we had hoisted all sail, those in front
had struck theirs. The wind came on hard ahead. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
sky became inflamed, and the lightning seemed to roll down
the sides of the hills which bordered the shore of the lake.
The storm in all its grandeur, majesty, and horror burst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
upon us in the Traverse, while making for Point De Sable;
and it required no moderate exertion to weather the point
and get to the windward side of it. Distance three miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-63" id="FNanchor_I-63" href="#Footnote_I-63" class="fnanchor">[I-63]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span></p>

<p>There we found Mr. Cameron,<a name="FNanchor_I-64" id="FNanchor_I-64" href="#Footnote_I-64" class="fnanchor">[I-64]</a> who had sailed from the
prairie [Prairie du Chien] on the 5th; he had three bark
canoes and a wooden one with him. He had been lying
here two days, his canoes unloaded and turned up for the
habitation of his men, his tents pitched, and himself living
in all the ease of an Indian trader. He appeared to be a
man of tolerable information, but rather indolent in his
habits; a Scotchman by birth, but an Englishman by prejudice.
He had with him a very handsome young man, by
the name of John Rudsdell, and also his own son, a lad of
fifteen.</p>

<p>The storm continuing, we remained all day. I was
shown a point of rocks [Maiden Rock, 400 feet high<a name="FNanchor_I-65" id="FNanchor_I-65" href="#Footnote_I-65" class="fnanchor">[I-65]</a>]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
from which a Sioux maiden cast herself, and was dashed
into a thousand pieces on the rocks below. She had been
informed that her friends intended matching her to a man
she despised; having been refused the man she had chosen,
she ascended the hill, singing her death-song; and before
they could overtake her and obviate her purpose she took
the lover's leap! Thus ended her troubles with her life.
A wonderful display of sentiment in a savage!</p>

<p><i>Sept. 18th.</i> Embarked after breakfast. Mr. Cameron,
with his boats, came on with me. Crossed the lake, sounded
it, and took an observation at the upper end. I embarked
in one of his canoes, and we came up to Canoe river,<a name="FNanchor_I-66" id="FNanchor_I-66" href="#Footnote_I-66" class="fnanchor">[I-66]</a> where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
there was a small band of Sioux under the command of
Red Wing, the second war chief in the nation. He made
me a speech and presented a pipe, pouch, and buffalo skin.
He appeared to be a man of sense, and promised to accompany
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
me to St. Peters [the Minnesota river]; he saluted me,
and had it returned. I made him a small present.<a name="FNanchor_I-67" id="FNanchor_I-67" href="#Footnote_I-67" class="fnanchor">[I-67]</a></p>

<p>We encamped on the end of the island, and although it
was not more than eleven o'clock, were obliged to stay all
night. Distance 18 miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-68" id="FNanchor_I-68" href="#Footnote_I-68" class="fnanchor">[I-68]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 19th.</i> Embarked early; dined at St. Croix<a name="FNanchor_I-69" id="FNanchor_I-69" href="#Footnote_I-69" class="fnanchor">[I-69]</a> river.
Messrs. Frazer and Cameron having some business to do
with the savages, we left them at the encampment; but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
promised to overtake me, though they should be obliged to
travel until twelve o'clock at night. Fired a blunderbuss for
them at Tattoo. The chain of my watch became unhooked,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
by lending her to my guard; this was a very serious misfortune.<a name="FNanchor_I-70" id="FNanchor_I-70" href="#Footnote_I-70" class="fnanchor">[I-70]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 20th.</i> Embarked after sunrise. Cloudy, with hard
head winds; a small shower of rain; cleared up in the afternoon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
and became pleasant. Encamped on a prairie on the
east side, on which is a large painted stone, about eight
miles below the Sioux village. The traders had not yet
overtaken me. Distance 26Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_I-71" id="FNanchor_I-71" href="#Footnote_I-71" class="fnanchor">[I-71]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74-75</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 21st.</i> Embarked at a seasonable hour; breakfasted
at the Sioux village on the east side [near St. Paul,<a name="FNanchor_I-72" id="FNanchor_I-72" href="#Footnote_I-72" class="fnanchor">[I-72]</a> capital of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
Minnesota]. It consists of 11 lodges, and is situated at the
head of an island just below a ledge of rocks [Dayton bluff,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
in the city]. The village was evacuated at this time, all the
Indians having gone out to the lands to gather fols avoin
[folle avoine, wild rice: see <a href="#Footnote_I-44">note<sup>44</sup></a>, page 39]. About two
miles above, saw three bears swimming over the river, but
at too great a distance for us to have killed them; they
made the shore before I could come up with them. Passed
a camp of Sioux, of four lodges, in which I saw only one
man, whose name was Black Soldier. The garrulity of the
women astonished me, for at the other camps they never
opened their lips; but here they flocked around us with all
their tongues going at the same time. The cause of this
freedom must have been the absence of their lords and
masters. Passed the encampment of Mr. Ferrebault [Faribault<a name="FNanchor_I-73" id="FNanchor_I-73" href="#Footnote_I-73" class="fnanchor">[I-73]</a>],
who had broken his peroque and had encamped on
the west side of the river, about three miles below St.
Peters [under the bluff below Mendota]. We made our encampment
on the N. E. point of the big [Pike's] island
opposite [Fort Snelling or] St. Peters.<a name="FNanchor_I-74" id="FNanchor_I-74" href="#Footnote_I-74" class="fnanchor">[I-74]</a> Distance 24 miles.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>The Mississippi became so very narrow this day, that I
once crossed in my batteaux with forty strokes of my oars.
The water of the Mississippi, since we passed Lake Pepin,
has been remarkably red; and where it is deep, appears as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
black as ink. The waters of the St. Croix and St. Peters
appear blue and clear, for a considerable distance below their
confluence.</p>

<p>I observed a white flag on shore to-day, and on landing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
discovered it to be white silk; it was suspended over a
scaffold, on which were laid four dead bodies, two inclosed
in boards, and two in bark. They were wrapped up in
blankets, which appeared to be quite new. They were the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
bodies, I was informed, of two Sioux women who had lived
with two Frenchmen, one of their children, and some other
relative; two of whom died at St. Peters and two at St.
Croix, but were brought here to be deposited upon this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
scaffold together. This is the manner of Sioux burial when
persons die a natural death; but when they are killed they
suffer them to lie unburied. This circumstance brought to
my recollection the bones of a man I found on the hills
below the St. Croix; the jaw bone I brought on board. He
must have been killed on that spot.

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY, CONTINUED: ST. PAUL TO LEECH LAKE, SEPTEMBER
22D, 1805-JANUARY 31ST, 1806.</span></h2>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 22d.</i> Employed in the morning
measuring the river. About three o'clock Mr. Frazer
and his peroques arrived; and in three hours after Petit
Corbeau, at the head of his band, arrived with 150 warriors.</p>

<p>They ascended the hill in the point between the Mississippi
and St. Peters, and gave us a salute, <i>a la mode savage</i>,
with balls; after which we settled affairs for the council
next day. Mr. Frazer and myself took a bark canoe, and
went up to the village, in order to see Mr. Cameron. We
ascended the St. Peters to the village, and found his camp.
He engaged to be at the council the next day, and promised
to let me have his barge. The Sioux had marched on a war
excursion; but, hearing by express of my arrival, they
returned by land. We were treated very hospitably, and
hallooed after to go into every lodge to eat. Returned to
our camp about eleven o'clock, and found the Sioux and my
men peaceably encamped. No current in the river.<a name="FNanchor_II-1" id="FNanchor_II-1" href="#Footnote_II-1" class="fnanchor">[II-1]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 23d.</i> Prepared for the council, which we commenced
about twelve o'clock. I had a bower or shade, made
of my sails, on the beach, into which only my gentlemen
(the traders) and the chiefs entered. I then addressed them
in a speech, which, though long and touching on many
points, had for its principal object the granting of land at
this place, falls of St. Anthony, and St. Croix [river], and
making peace with the Chipeways. I was replied to by Le
Fils de Pinchow, Le Petit Corbeau, and l'Original Leve.
They gave me the land required, about 100,000 acres, equal
to $200,000, and promised me a safe passport for myself
and any [Chippewa] chiefs I might bring down; but spoke
doubtfully with respect to the peace. I gave them presents
to the amount of about $200, and as soon as the council was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
over, I allowed the traders to present them with some
liquor, which, with what I myself gave, was equal to 60
gallons. In one half-hour they were all embarked for their
respective villages.</p>

<p>The chiefs in the council were: Le Petit Corbeau, who
signed the grant; Le Fils de Pinchow, who also signed;
Le Grand Partisan; Le Original Leve, war-chief; gave him
my father's [General Wilkinson's] tomahawk, etc.; Le Demi
Douzen, war-chief; Le Beccasse; Le B&oelig;uf que Marche.</p>

<p>It was somewhat difficult to get them to sign the grant, as
they conceived their word of honor should be taken for the
grant without any mark; but I convinced then it was not on
their account, but my own, that I wished them to sign it.<a name="FNanchor_II-2" id="FNanchor_II-2" href="#Footnote_II-2" class="fnanchor">[II-2]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 24th.</i> In the morning I discovered that my flag
was missing from my boat. Being in doubt whether it had
been stolen by the Indians, or had fallen overboard and
floated away, I sent for my friend, Original Leve, and
sufficiently evinced to him, by the vehemence of my action,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
by the immediate punishment of my guard (having inflicted
on one of them corporeal punishment), and by sending
down the shore three miles in search of it, how much I was
displeased that such a thing should have occurred. I sent
a flag and two carrots of tobacco, by Mr. Cameron, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Sioux at the head of the St. Peters; made a small draft of
the position at this place; sent up the boat I got from Mr.
Fisher to the village on the St. Peters, and exchanged her
for a barge with Mr. Duncan. My men returned with the
barge about sundown. She was a fine light thing; eight
men were able to carry her. Employed all day in writing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 25th.</i> I was awakened out of my bed by Le Petit
Corbeau, head chief, who came up from his village to see if
we were all killed, or if any accident had happened to us.
This was in consequence of their having found my flag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
floating three miles below their village, 15 miles hence, from
which they concluded some affray had taken place, and that
it had been thrown overboard. Although I considered this
an unfortunate accident for me, I was exceedingly happy
at its effect; for it was the occasion of preventing much
bloodshed among the savages. A chief called Outard
Blanche<a name="FNanchor_II-3" id="FNanchor_II-3" href="#Footnote_II-3" class="fnanchor">[II-3]</a> had his lip cut off, and had come to Petit
Corbeau and told him, "that his face was his looking-glass,
that it was spoiled, and that he was determined on revenge."
The parties were charging their guns and preparing
for action, when lo! the flag appeared like a messenger
of peace sent to prevent their bloody purposes. They were
all astonished to see it. The staff was broken. Then Petit
Corbeau arose and spoke to this effect: "That a thing so
sacred had not been taken from my boat without violence;
that it would be proper for them to hush all private animosities,
until they had revenged the cause of their eldest
brother; that he would immediately go up to St. Peters, to
know what dogs had done that thing, in order to take steps
to get satisfaction of those who had done the mischief."
They all listened to this reasoning; he immediately had
the flag put out to dry, and embarked for my camp. I was
much concerned to hear of the blood likely to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
shed, and gave him five yards of blue stroud, three yards of
calico, one handkerchief, one carrot of tobacco, and one
knife, in order to make peace among his people. He
promised to send my flag by land to the falls, and make
peace with Outard Blanche. Mr. Frazer went up to the
village. We embarked late, and encamped at the foot of
the rapids. In many places, I could scarce [almost] throw
a stone over the river. Distance three miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-4" id="FNanchor_II-4" href="#Footnote_II-4" class="fnanchor">[II-4]</a></p>

<p><i>Sept. 26th.</i> Embarked at the usual hour, and after much
labor in passing through the rapids, arrived at the foot of
the falls [of St. Anthony, in the city of Minneapolis], about
three or four o'clock; unloaded my boat, and had the principal
part of her cargo carried over the portage. With the
other boat, however, full loaded, they were not able to get
over the last shoot, and encamped about 600 yards below. I
pitched my tent and encamped above the shoot. The rapids
mentioned in this day's march might properly be called a
continuation of the falls of St. Anthony, for they are equally
entitled to this appellation with the falls of the Delaware
and Susquehanna. Killed one deer. Distance nine miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-5" id="FNanchor_II-5" href="#Footnote_II-5" class="fnanchor">[II-5]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sept. 27th.</i> Brought over the residue of my lading this
morning. Two men arrived from Mr. Frazer, on St. Peters,
for my dispatches. This business of closing and sealing
appeared like a last adieu to the civilized world. Sent a
large packet to the general, and a letter to Mrs. Pike, with a
short note to Mr. Frazer. Two young Indians brought my
flag across by land; they arrived yesterday, just as we came
in sight of the falls. I made them a present for their punctuality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
and expedition, and the danger they were exposed to
from the journey. Carried our boats out of the river as far
as the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 28th.</i> Brought my barge over, and put her in the
river above the falls. While we were engaged with her,
three-quarters of a mile from camp, seven Indians, painted
black, appeared on the heights. We had left our guns at
camp, and were entirely defenseless. It occurred to me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
that they were the small party of Sioux who were obstinate,
and would go to war when the other part of the bands came
in. These they proved to be. They were better armed
than any I had ever seen, having guns, bows, arrows,
clubs, spears, and some of them even a case of pistols.
I was at that time giving my men a dram, and giving the
cup of liquor to the first, he drank it off; but I was more
cautious with the remainder. I sent my interpreter to camp
with them to wait my coming, wishing to purchase one of
their war-clubs, which was made of elk-horn, and decorated
with inlaid work. This, and a set of bows and arrows, I
wished to get as a curiosity. But the liquor I had given
him beginning to operate, he came back for me; refusing
to go till I brought my boat, he returned, and (I suppose
being offended) borrowed a canoe and crossed the river. In
the afternoon we got the other boat near the top of the hill,
when the props gave way, and she slid all the way down
to the bottom, but fortunately without injuring any person.
It raining very hard, we left her. Killed one goose and a
raccoon.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Sept. 29th.</i> I killed a remarkably large raccoon.
Got our large boat over the portage, and put her in the
river, at the upper landing. This night the men gave sufficient
proof of their fatigue, by all throwing themselves down
to sleep, preferring rest to supper. This day I had but 15
men out of 22; the others were sick.</p>

<p>This voyage could have been performed with great convenience
if we had taken our departure in June. But the
proper time would be to leave the Illinois as soon as the ice
would permit, when the river would be of a good height.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 30th.</i> Loaded my boat, moved over, and encamped
on the island. The large boats loading likewise, we went
over and put on board. In the meantime I took a survey
of the Falls, Portage, etc. If it be possible to pass the falls
at high water, of which I am doubtful, it must be on the
east side, about 30 yards from shore, as there are three
layers of rocks, one below the other. The pitch off either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
is not more than five feet; but of this I can say more on my
return. (It is never possible, as ascertained on my return.)</p>

<p><i>Oct. 1st.</i> Embarked late. The river at first appeared
mild and sufficiently deep; but after about four miles the
shoals commenced, and we had very hard water all day;
passed three rapids. Killed one goose and two ducks.
This day the sun shone after I had left the falls; but whilst
there it was always cloudy. Distance 17 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-6" id="FNanchor_II-6" href="#Footnote_II-6" class="fnanchor">[II-6]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 2d.</i> Embarked at our usual hour, and shortly after
passed some large islands and remarkably hard ripples.
Indeed the navigation, to persons not determined to proceed,
would have been deemed impracticable. We waded
nearly all day, to force the boats off shoals, and draw them
through rapids. Killed three geese and two swans. Much
appearance of elk and deer. Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-7" id="FNanchor_II-7" href="#Footnote_II-7" class="fnanchor">[II-7]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95-96</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 3d.</i> Cold in the morning. Mercury at zero. Came on
very well; some ripples and shoals. Killed three geese and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
one raccoon [<i>Procyon lotor</i>]; also a brelaw,<a name="FNanchor_II-8" id="FNanchor_II-8" href="#Footnote_II-8" class="fnanchor">[II-8]</a> an animal I had
never before seen. Distance 15Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-9" id="FNanchor_II-9" href="#Footnote_II-9" class="fnanchor">[II-9]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 4th.</i> Rained in the morning; but the wind serving,
we embarked, although it was extremely raw and cold.
Opposite the mouth of Crow river [present name] we found
a bark canoe cut to pieces with tomahawks, and the paddles
broken on shore; a short distance higher up we saw five
more, and continued to see the wrecks until we found
eight. From the form of the canoes my interpreter pronounced
them to be Sioux; and some broken arrows to
be the Sauteurs. The paddles were also marked with the
Indian sign of men and women killed. From all these circumstances
we drew this inference, that the canoes had been
the vessels of a party of Sioux who had been attacked and
all killed or taken by the Sauteurs. Time may develop this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
transaction. My interpreter was much alarmed, assuring me
that it was probable that at our first rencounter with the Chipeways
they would take us for Sioux traders, and fire on us before
we could come to an explanation; that they had murdered
three Frenchmen whom they found on the shore about
this time last spring; but notwithstanding his information,
I was on shore all the afternoon in pursuit of elk. Caught
a curious little animal on the prairie, which my Frenchman
[Rousseau] termed a prairie mole,<a name="FNanchor_II-10" id="FNanchor_II-10" href="#Footnote_II-10" class="fnanchor">[II-10]</a> but it is very different
from the mole of the States. Killed two geese, one pheasant
[ruffed grouse, <i>Bonasa umbellus</i>], and a wolf. Distance
16 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-11" id="FNanchor_II-11" href="#Footnote_II-11" class="fnanchor">[II-11]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 5th.</i> Hard water and ripples all day. Passed several
old Sioux encampments, all fortified. Found five litters in
which sick or wounded had been carried. At this place
a hard battle was fought between the Sioux and Sauteurs
in the year 1800. Killed one goose. Distance 11 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-12" id="FNanchor_II-12" href="#Footnote_II-12" class="fnanchor">[II-12]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 6th.</i> Early in the morning discovered four
elk; they swam the river. I pursued them, and wounded
one, which made his escape into a marsh; saw two droves
of elk. I killed some small game and joined the boats near
night. Found a small red capot hung upon a tree; this my
interpreter informed me was a sacrifice by some Indians to
the <i>bon Dieu</i>. I determined to lie by and hunt next day.
Killed three prairie-hens [pinnated grouse, <i>Tympanuchus
americanus</i>] and two pheasants. This day saw the first elk.
Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-13" id="FNanchor_II-13" href="#Footnote_II-13" class="fnanchor">[II-13]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 7th.</i> Lay by in order to dry my corn, clothing, etc.,
and to have an investigation into the conduct of my sergeant
[Kennerman], against whom some charges were
exhibited. Sent several of my men out hunting. I went
toward evening and killed some prairie-hens; the hunters
were unsuccessful. Killed three prairie-hens and six
pheasants.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 8th.</i> Embarked early and made a very good day's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
march; had but three rapids to pass all day. Some oak
woodland on the W. side, but the whole bottom covered
with prickly-ash. I made it a practice to oblige every man
to march who complained of indisposition, by which means
I had some flankers on both sides of the river, who were
excellent guards against surprises; they also served as
hunters. We had but one raccoon killed by all. Distance
20 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-14" id="FNanchor_II-14" href="#Footnote_II-14" class="fnanchor">[II-14]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 9th.</i> Embarked early; wind ahead; barrens and
prairie. Killed one deer and four pheasants. Distance
3 miles. [Camp between Plum creek and St. Augusta.]</p>

<p><i>Oct. 10th.</i> Came to large islands and strong water early
in the morning. Passed the place at which Mr. [Joseph]
Reinville and Mons. Perlier [?] wintered in 1797. Passed
a cluster of more than 20 islands in the course of four
miles; these I called Beaver islands, from the immense sign
of those animals; for they have dams on every island and
roads from them every two or three rods. I would here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
attempt a description of this wonderful animal, and its
admirable system of architecture, were not the subject
already exhausted by the numerous travelers who have
written on this subject. Encamped at the foot of the
Grand [Sauk] Rapids. Killed two geese, five ducks, and
four pheasants. Distance 16Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-15" id="FNanchor_II-15" href="#Footnote_II-15" class="fnanchor">[II-15]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 11th.</i> Both boats passed the worst of the rapids by
eleven o'clock, but we were obliged to wade and lift them
over rocks where there was not a foot of water, when at times
the next step would be in water over our heads. In consequence
of this our boats were frequently in imminent danger
of being bilged on the rocks. About five miles above the
rapids our large boat was discovered to leak so fast as to
render it necessary to unload her, which we did. Stopped
the leak and reloaded. Near a war-encampment I found
a painted buckskin and a piece of scarlet cloth, suspended
by the limb of a tree; this I supposed to be a sacrifice to
Matcho Maniton [<i>sic</i>], to render their enterprise successful;
but I took the liberty of invading the rights of his diabolical
majesty, by treating them as the priests of old have often
done&mdash;that is, converting the sacrifice to my own use.
Killed only two ducks. Distance 8 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-16" id="FNanchor_II-16" href="#Footnote_II-16" class="fnanchor">[II-16]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 12th.</i> Hard ripples in the morning. Passed a narrow
rocky place [Watab rapids], after which we had good
water. Our large boat again sprung a leak, and we were
again obliged to encamp early and unload. Killed one deer,
one wolf, two geese, and two ducks. Distance 12Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-17" id="FNanchor_II-17" href="#Footnote_II-17" class="fnanchor">[II-17]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 13th.</i> Embarked early and came on well.
Passed [first a river on the right, which we named Lake
river (now called Little Rock river) and then] a handsome
little river on the east, which we named Clear river [now
Platte]; water good. Killed one deer, one beaver, two
minks, two geese, and one duck. Fair winds. Discovered
one buffalo sign. Distance 29 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-18" id="FNanchor_II-18" href="#Footnote_II-18" class="fnanchor">[II-18]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 14th.</i> Ripples a considerable [part of the] way. My
hunters killed three deer, four geese, and two porcupines.
When hunting discovered a trail which I supposed to have
been made by the savages. I followed it with much precaution,
and at length started a large bear feeding on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
carcass of a deer; he soon made his escape. Yesterday we
came to the first timbered land above the falls. Made the
first discovery of bear since we left St. Louis, excepting
what we saw three miles below St. Peters. Distance 17
miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-19" id="FNanchor_II-19" href="#Footnote_II-19" class="fnanchor">[II-19]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 15th.</i> Ripples all day. In the morning the large
boat came up, and I once more got my party together; they
had been detained by taking in the game. Yesterday and
this day passed some skirts of good land, well timbered,
swamps of hemlock, and white pine. Water very hard. The
river became shallow and full of islands. We encamped on
a beautiful point on the west, below a fall [Fourth, Knife, or
Pike rapids] of the river over a bed of rocks, through which
we had two narrow shoots to make our way the next day.
Killed two deer, five ducks, and two geese. This day's
march made me think seriously of our wintering ground and
leaving our large boats. Distance five miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-20" id="FNanchor_II-20" href="#Footnote_II-20" class="fnanchor">[II-20]</a></p>

<p><i>Oct. 16th.</i> When we arose in the morning found that
snow had fallen during the night; the ground was covered,
and it continued to snow. This indeed was but poor encouragement
for attacking the rapids, in which we were certain to
wade to our necks. I was determined, however, if possible,
to make la riviere de Corbeau [now Crow Wing river], the
highest point ever made by traders in their bark canoes.
We embarked, and after four hours' work became so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
benumbed with cold that our limbs were perfectly useless.
We put to shore on the opposite side of the river, about two-thirds
of the way up the rapids. Built a large fire; and then
discovered that our boats were nearly half-full of water, both
having sprung such large leaks as to oblige me to keep three
hands bailing. My Sergeant Kennerman, one of the stoutest
men I ever knew, broke a blood-vessel and vomited nearly
two quarts of blood. One of my corporals, Bradley, also
evacuated nearly a pint of blood when he attempted to void
his urine. These unhappy circumstances, in addition to the
inability of four other men, whom we were obliged to leave
on shore, convinced me that if I had no regard for my own
health and constitution, I should have some for those poor
fellows, who were killing themselves to obey my orders.
After we had breakfasted and refreshed ourselves, we went
down to our boats on the rocks, where I was obliged to leave
them. I then informed my men that we would return to
the camp, and there leave some of the party and our large
boats. This information was pleasing, and the attempt to
reach the camp soon accomplished.</p>

<p>My reasons for this step have partly been already stated.
The necessity of unloading and refitting my boats, the
beauty and convenience of the spot for building huts, the
fine pine trees for peroques, and the quantity of game, were
additional inducements. We immediately unloaded our
boats and secured their cargoes. In the evening I went out
upon a small but beautiful creek [<i>i. e.</i>, Pine creek of Pike,
now Swan river<a name="FNanchor_II-21" id="FNanchor_II-21" href="#Footnote_II-21" class="fnanchor">[II-21]</a>] which empties into the falls [on the W.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
side], for the purpose of selecting pine trees to make canoes.
Saw five deer, and killed one buck weighing 137 pounds.
By my leaving men at this place, and from the great quantities
of game in its vicinity, I was insured plenty of provision
for my return voyage. In the party [to be] left behind
was one hunter, to be continually employed, who would
keep our stock of salt provisions good. Distance 233Â½
[about 111] miles above the falls of St. Anthony.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p><i>Oct. 17th.</i> It continued to snow. I walked out in the
morning and killed four bears, and my hunter three deers.
Felled our trees for canoes and commenced working on
them.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 18th.</i> Stopped hunting and put every hand to work.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Cut 60 logs for huts and worked at the canoes. This, considering
we had only two felling-axes and three hatchets,
was pretty good work. Cloudy, with little snow.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 19th.</i> Raised one of our houses and almost completed
one canoe. I was employed the principal part of
this day in writing letters and making arrangements which
I deemed necessary, in case I should never return.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 20th.</i> Continued our labor at the houses
and canoes; finished my letters, etc. At night discovered
the prairie on the opposite side of the river to be on fire:
supposed to have been made by the Sauteurs. I wished
much to have our situation respectable [defensible] here, or
I would have sent next day to discover them.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 21st.</i> Went out hunting, but killed nothing, not
wishing to shoot at small game. Our labor went on.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 22d.</i> Went out hunting. About 15 miles up the
[Pine] creek saw a great quantity of deer; but from the
dryness of the woods and the quantity of brush, only shot
one through the body, which made its escape. This day
my men neglected their work, which convinced me I must
leave off hunting and superintend them. Miller and myself
lay out all night in the pine woods.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 23d.</i> Raised another blockhouse; deposited all our
property in the one already completed. Killed a number
of pheasants and ducks, while visiting my canoe-makers.
Sleet and snow.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 24th.</i> The snow having fallen one or two inches
thick in the night, I sent out one hunter, Sparks, and went
out myself; Bradley, my other hunter, being sick. Each of
us killed two deer, one goose, and one pheasant.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 25th.</i> Sent out men with Sparks to bring in his
game. None of them returned, and I supposed them to be
lost in the hemlock swamps with which the country abounds.
My interpreter, however, whom I believe to be a coward,
insisted that they were killed by the Sauteurs. Made
arrangements for my departure.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 26th.</i> Launched my canoes and found them very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
small. My hunter killed three deer. Took Miller and
remained out all night, but killed nothing.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Oct. 27th.</i> Employed in preparing our baggage
to depart.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 28th.</i> My two canoes being finished, launched, and
brought to the head of the rapids, I put my provision,
ammunition, etc., on board, intending to embark by day.
Left them under the charge of the sentinel; in an hour one
of them sunk, in which was the ammunition and my baggage;
this was occasioned by what is called a wind-shock.<a name="FNanchor_II-22" id="FNanchor_II-22" href="#Footnote_II-22" class="fnanchor">[II-22]</a>
This misfortune, and the extreme smallness of my canoes,
induced me to build another. I had my cartridges spread
out on blankets and large fires made around them. At that
time I was not able to ascertain the extent of the misfortune,
the magnitude of which none can estimate, save
only those in the same situation with ourselves, 1,500 miles
from civilized society; and in danger of losing the very
means of defense&mdash;nay, of existence.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 29th.</i> Felled a large pine and commenced another
canoe. I was at work on my cartridges all day, but did not
save five dozen out of 30. In attempting to dry the powder
in pots I blew it up, and it had nearly blown up a tent and
two or three men with it. Made a dozen new cartridges
with the old wrapping-paper.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 30th.</i> My men labored as usual. Nothing extraordinary.</p>

<p><i>Oct. 31st.</i> Inclosed my little work completely with
pickets. Hauled up my two boats, and turned them over
on each side of the gateway, by which means a defense
was made to the river. Had it not been for various political
reasons, I would have laughed at the attack of 800 or 1,000
savages, if all my party were within. For, except accidents,
it would only have afforded amusement, the Indians having
no idea of taking a place by storm. Found myself powerfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
attacked with the fantastics of the brain called ennui,
at the mention of which I had hitherto scoffed; but my
books being packed up, I was like a person entranced, and
could easily conceive why so many persons who had been
confined to remote places acquired the habit of drinking
to excess and many other vicious practices, which have
been adopted merely to pass time.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 1st.</i> Finding that my canoe would not be finished
in two or three days, I concluded to take six men and go
down the river about 12 miles [vicinity of Buffalo cr. (Two
Rivers)], where we had remarked great sign of elk and
buffalo. Arrived there about the middle of the afternoon.
All turned out to hunt. None of us killed anything but
Sparks, one doe. A slight snow fell.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 2d.</i> Left the camp with the fullest determination
to kill an elk, if it were possible, before my return. I never
had killed one of those animals. Took Miller, whose
obliging disposition made him agreeable in the woods.
I was determined, if we came on the trail of elk, to follow
them a day or two in order to kill one. This, to a person
acquainted with the nature of those animals, and the extent
of the prairies in this country, would appear, what it really
was, a very foolish resolution. We soon struck where a
herd of 150 had passed. Pursued and came in sight about
eight o'clock, when they appeared, at a distance, like an
army of Indians moving along in single file; a large buck,
of at least four feet between the horns, leading the
van, and one of equal magnitude bringing up the rear.
We followed until near night, without once being able
to get within pointblank shot. I once made Miller fire
at them with his musket, at about 400 yards' distance;
it had no other effect than to make them leave us about
five miles behind on the prairie. Passed several deer in
the course of the day, which I think we could have killed,
but did not fire for fear of alarming the elk. Finding that
it was no easy matter to kill one, I shot a doe through the
body, as I perceived by her blood where she lay down in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
the snow; yet, not knowing how to track, we lost her.
Shortly after saw three elk by themselves near a copse of
woods. Approached near them and broke the shoulder of
one; but he ran off with the other two just as I was about
to follow. Saw a buck deer lying on the grass; shot him
between the eyes, when he fell over. I walked up to him,
put my foot on his horns, and examined the shot; immediately
after which he snorted, bounced up, and fell five
steps from me. This I considered his last effort; but soon
after, to our utter astonishment, he jumped up and ran off.
He stopped frequently; we pursued him, expecting him to
fall every minute; by which we were led from the pursuit
of the wounded elk. After being wearied out in this unsuccessful
chase we returned in pursuit of the wounded elk,
and when we came up to the party, found him missing from
the flock. Shot another in the body; but my ball being
small, he likewise escaped. Wounded another deer; when,
hungry, cold, and fatigued, after having wounded three deer
and two elk, we were obliged to encamp in a point of hemlock
woods, on the head of Clear [Platte] river. The large
herd of elk lay about one mile from us, in the prairie. Our
want of success I ascribe to the smallness of our balls, and
to our inexperience in following the track after wounding
the game, for it is very seldom a deer drops on the spot
you shoot it.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 3d.</i> Rose pretty early and went in pursuit
of the elk. Wounded one buck deer on the way. We
made an attempt to drive them into the woods; but their
leader broke past us, and it appeared as if the drove would
have followed him, though they had been obliged to run
over us. We fired at them passing, but without effect.
Pursued them through the swamp till about ten o'clock,
when I determined to attempt to make the river, and for
that purpose took a due south course. Passed many droves
of elk and buffalo, but being in the middle of an immense
prairie, knew it was folly to attempt to shoot them.
Wounded several deer, but got none. In fact, I knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
I could shoot as many deer as anybody; but neither myself
nor company could find one in ten, whereas one experienced
hunter would get all. Near night struck a lake about five
miles long and two miles wide. Saw immense droves of
elk on both banks. About sundown saw a herd crossing
the prairie toward us. We sat down. Two bucks, more
curious than the others, came pretty close. I struck one
behind the fore shoulder; he did not go more than 20 yards
before he fell and died. This was the cause of much exultation,
because it fulfilled my determination; and, as we had
been two days and nights without victuals, it was very
acceptable. Found some scrub oak. In about one mile
made a fire, and with much labor and pains got our meat to
it; the wolves feasting on one half while we were carrying
away the other. We were now provisioned, but were still
in want of water, the snow being all melted. Finding my
drought very excessive in the night, I went in search of
water, and was much surprised, after having gone about
a mile, to strike the Mississippi. Filled my hat and
returned to my companion.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 4th.</i> Repaired my mockinsons, using a piece of elk's
bone as an awl. We both went to the Mississippi and found
we were a great distance from the camp. I left Miller to
guard the meat and marched for camp. Having strained
my ankles in the swamps, they were extremely sore, and
the strings of my mockinsons cut them and made them swell
considerably. Before I had gone far I discovered a herd of
10 elk; approached within 50 yards and shot one through
the body. He fell on the spot; but rose again and ran off.
I pursued him at least five miles, expecting every minute to
see him drop. I then gave him up. When I arrived at
Clear [Platte] river, a deer was standing on the other bank.
I killed him on the spot, and while I was taking out the
entrails another came up. I shot him also. This was my
last ball, and then only could I kill! Left part of my
clothes at this place to scare the wolves. Arrived at my
camp at dusk, to the great joy of our men, who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
to our little garrison to inquire for me, and receiving no
intelligence, had concluded we were killed by the Indians,
having heard them fire on the opposite bank. The same
night we saw fires on the opposite shore in the prairie; this
was likewise seen in the fort, when all the men moved into
the works.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 5th.</i> Sent four of my men with one canoe, loaded
with the balance of nine deer that had been killed; with the
other two, went down the river for my meat. Stopped for
the deer, which I found safe. Miller had just started to march
home, but returned to camp with us. Found all the meat
safe, and brought it to the river, where we pitched our camp.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 6th.</i> At the earnest entreaties of my men, and with
a hope of killing some more game, I agreed to stay and
hunt. We went out and found that all the elk and buffalo
had gone down the river from those plains the day before,
leaving large roads to point out their course. This would
not appear extraordinary to persons acquainted with the
nature of those animals, as the prairie had unluckily caught
fire. After Miller left the camp for home, Sparks killed
two deer, about six miles off; and it being near the river,
I sent the three men down with the canoe, to return early
in the morning. It commenced snowing about midnight,
and by morning was six inches deep.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 7th.</i> Waited all day with the greatest anxiety for
my men. The river became nearly filled with snow, partly
congealed into ice. My situation can more easily be imagined
than described. Went down the river to where I
understood the deer were killed; but discovered nothing of
my men. I now became very uneasy on their account, for
I was well aware of the hostile disposition of the Indians to
all persons on this part of the Mississippi, taking them to
be traders&mdash;and we had not yet had an opportunity of
explaining to them who we were. Snow still continued
falling very fast, and was nearly knee-deep. Had great
difficulty to procure wood sufficient to keep up a fire all
night. Ice in the river thickening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 8th.</i> My men not yet arrived. I determined to
depart for the garrison, and when the river had frozen, to
come down on the ice with a party, or, if the weather
became mild, by water, with my other peroques, to search
for my poor men. Put up about ten pounds of meat, two
blankets, and a bearskin, with my sword and gun, which
made for me a very heavy load. Left the meat in as good
a situation as possible. Wrote on the snow my wishes, and
put my handkerchief up as a flag. Departed. My anxiety
of mind was so great that, notwithstanding my load and the
depth of the snow, I made into the bottom, above our
former hunting-camp, a little before night. Passed several
deer and one elk, which I might probably have killed; but
not knowing whether I should be able to secure the meat
if I killed them, and bearing in mind that they were created
for the use and not the sport of man, I did not fire at them.
While I was endeavoring to strike fire I heard voices, and
looking round, observed Corporal Meek and three men
passing. Called them to me, and we embarked together.
They were on their march down to see if they could render
us any assistance in ascending the river. They were much
grieved to hear my report of the other men, Corporal
Bradley, Sparks, and Miller.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 9th.</i> Snowed a little. The men carried my pack.
I was so sore that it was with difficulty I carried my gun;
fortunately they brought with them a pair of mockinsons,
sent me by one of my soldiers, Owings, who had rightly
calculated that I was bare-foot; also a phial of whisky, sent
by the sergeant; were both very acceptable to me. They
brought also some tobacco for my lost men. We experienced
difficulty in crossing the river, owing to the ice.
Moved into the post my command, who were again encamped
out, ready to march up the river. Set all hands to
making sleds, in order that the moment the river closed I
might descend, with a strong party, in search of my lost
men. Issued provisions, and was obliged to use six venison
hams, being part of a quantity of elegant hams I had preserved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
to take down, if possible, to the general and some
other friends. Had the two hunters not been found, I must
have become a slave to hunting in order to support my party.
The ice still ran very thick.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 10th.</i> Continued making sleds. No news
of my hunters. Ice in the river very thick and hard. Raised
my tent with puncheons, and laid a floor in it.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 11th.</i> I went out hunting. Saw but two deer.
Killed a remarkably large black fox. Bradley and Miller
arrived, having understood the writing on the snow, and left
Sparks behind at the camp to take care of the meat. Their
detention was owing to their being lost on the prairie the
first night, and not being able to find their deer.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 12th.</i> Dispatched Miller and Huddleston to the
lower hunting-camp, and Bradley and Brown to hunting in
the woods. Made my arrangements in camp. Thawing
weather.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 13th.</i> Bradley returned with a very large buck,
which supplied us for the next four days.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 14th.</i> It commenced raining at 4 o'clock a. m.;
lightning and loud thunder. I went down the river in one
of my canoes, with five men, in order to bring up the meat
from the lower camp; but after descending about 13 miles,
found the river blocked up with ice. Returned about two
miles and encamped in the bottom where I had my hunting-camp
on the 1st inst. Extremely cold toward night.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 15th.</i> When we meant to embark in the morning,
found the river full of ice and hardly moving. Returned to
camp and went out to hunt, for we had no provision with
us. Killed nothing but five prairie-hens, which afforded us
this day's subsistence; this bird I took to be the same as
grouse. Expecting the ice had become hard, we attempted
to cross the river, but could not. In the endeavor one man
fell through. Freezing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 16th.</i> Detached Corporal Meek and one private to
the garrison, to order the sleds down. No success in hunting,
except a few fowl. I began to consider the life of a hunter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
a very slavish life, and extremely precarious as to support;
for sometimes I have myself, although no hunter, killed 600
weight of meat in one day; and I have hunted three days
successively without killing anything but a few small birds,
which I was obliged to do to keep my men from starving.
Freezing.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 17th.</i> One of my men arrived; he had attempted
to make the camp before, but lost himself in the
prairie, lay out all night, and froze his toes. He informed
us that the corporal and the men I sent with him had their
toes frost-bitten, the former very badly; that three men were
on their way down by land, the river above not being frozen
over. They arrived a few hours before night. Freezing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 18th.</i> Took our departure down the river on the
ice, our baggage on the sled. Ice very rough. Distance
12 miles. Freezing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 19th.</i> Arrived opposite our hunting-camp about
noon. Had the meat, etc., moved over. They had a large
quantity of meat. I went out and killed a very large buck.
Thawing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 20th.</i> Departed to return to the stockade, part of
our meat on the sled and part in the little peroque, the
river being open in the middle. Killed four deer. Thawing.
Distance five miles.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 21st.</i> Marched in the morning. Came to a place
where the river was very narrow, and the channel blocked
up. Were obliged to unload our peroque and haul her
over. The river having swelled a good deal at this place
the ice gave way with myself and two men on it. We
seized the sled that stood by us, with some little baggage
on it, and by jumping over four cracks, the last
two feet wide, providentially made our passage good without
losing an individual thing. Encamped opposite Clear
[Platte] river. Killed one deer and one otter. Freezing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 22d.</i> Were obliged to leave our canoe at Clear river,
the river being closed. Made two trips with our sled.
Killed one deer. Distance five miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 23d.</i> Having seen a great deal of buffalo sign, I
determined to kill one the next day&mdash;forgetting the elk
chase. Encamped nearly opposite our camp of the 15th
and 16th. Thawing. Distance four miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Nov. 24th.</i> Took Miller and Boley and went in
pursuit of buffalo. Came up with some about ten o'clock.
In the afternoon wounded one. Pursued them until night,
and encamped on the side of a swamp. Thawing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 25th.</i> Commenced again the pursuit of the buffalo,
and continued till eleven o'clock, when I gave up the chase.
Arrived at the camp about sundown, hungry and weary,
having eaten nothing since we left it. My rifle carried too
small a ball to kill buffalo; the balls should not be more
than 30 to the pound&mdash;an ounce ball would be still preferable&mdash;and
the animal should be hunted on horse-back.
I think that in the prairies of this country the bow and
arrow could be used to more advantage than the gun;
for you might ride immediately alongside, and strike them
where you pleased, leaving them to proceed after others.
Thawing.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 26th.</i> Proceeded up the river. The ice getting
very rotten, the men fell through several times. Thawing.
Distance five miles.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 27th.</i> Took one man and marched to the post.
Found all well. My hunter, Bradley, had killed 11 deer
since my departure. Sent all the men down to help the
party up. They returned, accompanied by two Indians,
who informed me they were two men of a band who resided
on Lake Superior, called the Fols Avoins, but spoke the
language of the Chipeways. They informed me that Mr.
Dickson's<a name="FNanchor_II-23" id="FNanchor_II-23" href="#Footnote_II-23" class="fnanchor">[II-23]</a> and the other trading-houses were established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
about 60 miles below, and that there were 70 lodges of
Sioux on the Mississippi. All my men arrived at the post.
We brought from our camp below the balance of 17 deer
and 2 elk.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 28th.</i> The Indians departed, much pleased with
their reception. I dispatched Corporal Meek and one private
down to Dickson with a letter, which would at least
have the effect of attaching the most powerful tribes in this
quarter to my interest.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 29th.</i> A Sioux, the son of a warrior called the
Killeur Rouge,<a name="FNanchor_II-24" id="FNanchor_II-24" href="#Footnote_II-24" class="fnanchor">[II-24]</a> of the Gens des Feuilles, and a Fols Avoin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
came to the post. He said that having struck our trail
below and finding some to be shoe-tracks, he conceived it
to be the establishment of some traders, took it, and came
to the post. He informed me that Mr. Dickson had told
the Sioux "that they might now hunt where they pleased,
as I had gone ahead and would cause the Chipeways,
wherever I met them, to treat them with friendship; that
I had barred up the mouth of the St. Peters, so that no
liquor could ascend that river; but that if they came on
the Mississippi they should have what liquor they wanted;
also, that I was on the river and had a great deal of merchandise
to give them in presents." This information of
Mr. Dickson to the Indians seemed to have self-interest and
envy for its motives; for, by the idea of my having prevented
liquor from going up the St. Peters he gave the
Indians to understand that it was a regulation of my own,
and not a law of the United States; by assuring them he
would sell to them on the Mississippi, he drew all the
Indians from the traders on the St. Peters, who had
adhered to the restriction of not selling liquor; and should
any of them be killed the blame would all lie on me, as he
had without authority assured them they might hunt in
security. I took care to give the young chief a full explanation
of my ideas on the subject. He remained all
night. Killed two deer.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 30th.</i> I made the two Indians some small presents.
They crossed the river and departed. Detached Kennerman
with 11 men to bring up the two canoes.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 1st.</i> Snowed a little in the middle of the
day. Went out with my gun, but killed nothing.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 2d.</i> Sparks arrived from the party below, and
informed me they could not kill any game, but had started
up with the little peroque; also, that Mr. Dickson and
a Frenchman had passed my detachment about three hours
before. He left them on their march to the post. Sparks
arrived about ten o'clock at night.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 3d.</i> Mr. Dickson, with an engagee and a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Indian, arrived at the fort. I received him with every
politeness in my power, and after a serious conversation
with him on the subject of the information given me on the
29th ult., was induced to believe it in part incorrect. He
assured me that no liquor was sold by him, or by any
houses under his direction. He gave me much useful information
relative to my future route, which gave me great
encouragement as to the certainty of my accomplishing the
object of my voyage to the fullest extent. He seemed to
be a gentleman of general commercial knowledge, possessing
much geographical information of the western country,
and of open, frank manners. He gave me many assurances
of his good wishes for the prosperity of my undertaking.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 4th.</i> My men arrived with one canoe only. Calculated
on returning them two days later.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 5th.</i> Mr. Dickson, with his two men, departed for
their station [in the vicinity of Thousand Islands, below St.
Cloud], after having furnished me with a letter for a young
man of his house on Lake de Sable [Sandy lake], and
<i>carte blanche</i> as to my commands on him. Weather mild.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 6th.</i> I dispatched my men down to bring up the
other peroque with a strong sled on which it was intended
to put the canoe about one-third, and to let the end drag on
the ice. Three families of the Fols Avoins arrived and
encamped near the fort; also, one Sioux, who pretended to
have been sent to me from the Gens des Feuilles, to inform
me that the Yanctongs and Sussitongs,<a name="FNanchor_II-25" id="FNanchor_II-25" href="#Footnote_II-25" class="fnanchor">[II-25]</a> two bands of Sioux
from the head of the St. Peters and the Missouri, and the
most savage of them, had commenced the war-dance and
would depart in a few days; in which case he conceived it
would be advisable for the Fols Avoins to keep close under
my protection; that making a stroke on the Chipeways
would tend to injure the grand object of my voyage, etc.
Some reasons induced me to believe he was a self-created
envoy; however, I offered to pay him, or any young Sioux,
who would go to those bands and carry my word. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
promised to make known my wishes upon his return. My
men returned in the evening without my canoe, having
been so unfortunate as to split her in carrying her over the
rough hilly ice in the ripples below. So many disappointments
almost wearied out my patience; notwithstanding,
I intended to embark by land and water in a few days.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 7th.</i> An Indian by the name of Chien Blanche,<a name="FNanchor_II-26" id="FNanchor_II-26" href="#Footnote_II-26" class="fnanchor">[II-26]</a>
of the Fols Avoin tribe, with his family and connections,
arrived and encamped near the stockade. He informed me
that he had wintered here for ten years past; that the sugar-camp
near the stockade was where he made sugar. He
appeared to be an intelligent man. I visited his camp in the
afternoon, and found him seated amidst his children and
grandchildren, amounting in all to ten. His wife, although
of an advanced age, was suckling two children that appeared
to be about two years old. I should have taken them to be
twins, had not one been much fairer than the other. Upon
inquiry, however, I found that the fairest was the daughter
of an Englishman, by one of the Indian's daughters, lately
deceased; since whose death the grandmother had taken it
to the breast. His lodge was made of rushes plaited into
mats, after the manner of the Illinois. I was obliged to
give some meat to all the Indians who arrived at the stockade,
at the same time explaining our situation. The Chien
Blanche assured me it should be repaid with interest in the
course of the winter, but that at that time he was without
anything to eat. In fact, our hunters having killed nothing
for several days, we were ourselves on short allowance.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 8th.</i> An invalid Sioux arrived with the information
that the bands of the Sussitongs and Yanctongs had actually
determined to make war on the Chipeways, and that
they had formed a party of 150 or 160 men; but that part
of the Sussitongs had refused to go to war, and would be
here on a visit to me the next day. This occasioned me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
to delay crossing the river immediately, on my voyage to
Lake Sang Sue [Leech lake], as it was possible that by having
a conference with them I might still prevent the stroke
intended to be made against the Chipeways.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 9th.</i> Prepared to embark. Expecting the Sioux, I
had two large kettles of soup made for them. Had a shooting-match
with four prizes. The Sioux did not arrive, and
we ate the soup ourselves. Crossed the river and encamped
above the [Knife or Pike] rapids.<a name="FNanchor_II-27" id="FNanchor_II-27" href="#Footnote_II-27" class="fnanchor">[II-27]</a> Wind changed and it
grew cold.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 10th.</i> After arranging our sleds and peroque we
commenced our march. My sleds were such as are frequently
seen about farmers' yards, calculated to hold two
barrels or 400 weight, in which two men were geared abreast.
The sleds on the prairie and the peroque were towed by
three men. Found it extremely difficult to get along, the
snow being melted off the prairie in spots. The men who
had the canoe were obliged to wade and drag her over the
rocks in many places. Shot the only deer I saw; it fell three
times, and then made its escape. This was a great disappointment,
for upon the game we took now we depended
for our subsistence. This evening disclosed to my men the
real danger they had to encounter. Distance five miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-28" id="FNanchor_II-28" href="#Footnote_II-28" class="fnanchor">[II-28]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dec. 11th.</i> It having thawed all night, the snow had almost
melted from the prairie. I walked on until ten o'clock,
and made a fire. I then went back to look for the peroque,
and at a remarkable [Little Elk] rapid in the river, opposite
a high piny island, made a fire and waited for them to come
up, when we partly unloaded. I returned and met the
sleds. When we arrived at the place pitched on for our
camp, I sent the men down to assist the peroque. In the
afternoon, from about three o'clock, we heard the report of
not less than 50 guns ahead, and after dusk much shooting
on the prairie. I was at a loss to know who they could be,
unless they were Sauteaux, and what could be their object
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
in shooting after dark. Kept a good lookout. Distance
five miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-29" id="FNanchor_II-29" href="#Footnote_II-29" class="fnanchor">[II-29]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 12th.</i> The snow having almost entirely left the
prairie, we were obliged to take on but one sled at a time
and treble man it. In the morning my interpreter came to
me with quite a martial air, and requested that he might be
allowed to go ahead to discover what Indians we heard fire
last evening. I gave him permission and away he went.
Shortly after, I went out with Corporal Bradley and a private,
and in about an hour overtook my partizan, on a bottom
close to the river; he was hunting raccoons, and had caught
five. We left him; and after choosing an encampment and
sending the private back to conduct the party to it, the
corporal and myself marched on, anxious to discover the
Indians. We ascended the river about eight miles; saw
no Indians, but discovered that the river was frozen over.
This pleased me more, for we would now be enabled to
walk three times our usual distance in a day.</p>

<p>I was much surprised that we saw no Indians. After our
return to camp I was told that a Fols Avoin Indian had met
my party and informed them that in the rear of the hills
that bordered the prairie there were many small lakes which
by portages communicated with Lake Superior; that in one
day's march on that course we would find English trading-houses;
that the Chipeways were there hunting; that the
Sioux who had visited my camp on the 29th ult., on hearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the firing, had prudently returned with his companions to
the west side of the Mississippi, agreeably to my advice.
How persons unacquainted with the searching spirit of trade
and the enterprise of the people of the northwest would be
surprised to find people who had penetrated from Lake
Superior to lakes little more than marshes! It likewise
points out the difficulty of putting a barrier on their trade.</p>

<p>All my sleds and peroques did not get up until half-past
ten o'clock. Saw a very beautiful fox, with red back, white
tail and breast. My interpreter called them reynard d'argent
[silver fox]. I had no opportunity of shooting him.
Killed six raccoons and one porcupine [<i>Erethizon dorsatum</i>].
Fine day. Distance seven miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-30" id="FNanchor_II-30" href="#Footnote_II-30" class="fnanchor">[II-30]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 13th.</i> Made double trips. Embarked at the upper
end of the ripples. It commenced snowing at three o'clock.
Bradley killed one deer, another man killed one raccoon.
Storm continued until next morning. Distance five miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-31" id="FNanchor_II-31" href="#Footnote_II-31" class="fnanchor">[II-31]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 14th.</i> We departed from our encampment at the
usual hour, but had not advanced one mile when the foremost
sled, which happened unfortunately to carry my baggage
and ammunition, fell into the river. We were all in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
the river up to our middle in recovering the things. Halted
and made a fire. Came to where the river was frozen over.
Stopped and encamped on the west shore, in a pine wood
["Pine camp" of Mar. 4th, 1806]. Upon examining my
things, found all my baggage wet and some of my books
materially injured; but a still greater injury was, that all
my cartridges and four pounds of double battle Sussex
powder which I had brought for my own use, were destroyed.
Fortunately my kegs of powder were preserved dry, and
some bottles of common glazed powder, which were so
tightly corked as not to admit water. Had this not been
the case, my voyage must necessarily have been terminated,
for we could not have subsisted without ammunition. During
the time of our misfortune, two Fols Avoin Indians
came to us, one of whom was at my stockade on the 29th
ult., in company with the Sioux. I signified to them by
signs the place of our encampment, and invited them to
come and encamp with us. They left me and both arrived
at my camp in the evening, having each a deer which they
presented me; I gave them my canoe to keep until spring,
and in the morning at parting made them a small present.
Sat up until three o'clock drying and assorting my ammunition,
baggage, etc. Killed two deer. Distance four miles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 15th.</i> Remained at our camp making sleds.
Killed two deer. Crossed and recrossed several Indian
trails in the woods.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 16th.</i> Remained at the same camp, employed as
yesterday. Killed three deer. I wounded a buffalo in the
shoulder, and by a fair race overtook him in the prairie and
gave him another shot; but it being near night left him till
morning.<a name="FNanchor_II-32" id="FNanchor_II-32" href="#Footnote_II-32" class="fnanchor">[II-32]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dec. 17th.</i> Departed from our agreeable encampment at
an early hour. Found our sleds to be very heavily loaded.
Broke one sled-runner and were detained by other circumstances.
Bradley, Rosseau the interpreter, and myself killed
four deer and wounded five others. Having 11 on hand
already, I found it necessary to leave behind some of my
other lading. At night we dug a hole, four feet deep, three
feet wide, and six feet long, in which we put one barrel of
pork and one barrel of flour, after wrapping them up in
seven deerskins to preserve them from the damp; we then
filled up the hole and built our fire immediately over it.<a name="FNanchor_II-33" id="FNanchor_II-33" href="#Footnote_II-33" class="fnanchor">[II-33]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 18th.</i> Did not get off until eight o'clock, from the
delay in bringing in our meat. Ice tolerably good. Began
to see the Chipeway encampments very frequently, but had
not entirely left the Sioux country on the western shore.
Beautiful pine ridges.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 19th.</i> Were obliged to take to the prairie, from the
river's being open: but the snow was frozen hard and the
sleds did not sink deep, so that we made a pretty good day's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
journey. Killed one deer and two otters. River still open.
Distance 10 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-34" id="FNanchor_II-34" href="#Footnote_II-34" class="fnanchor">[II-34]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 20th.</i> Traveled part of the day on the prairie and
on the ice. Killed one deer. Heard three reports of guns
just at sunset, from the opposite side of the river. Deposited
one barrel of flour. Distance seven miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-35" id="FNanchor_II-35" href="#Footnote_II-35" class="fnanchor">[II-35]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 21st.</i> Bradley and myself went on ahead and overtook
my interpreter, who had left camp very early in hopes
that he would be able to see the river De Corbeau, where
he had twice wintered. He was immediately opposite a
large island [Ãle de Corbeau<a name="FNanchor_II-36" id="FNanchor_II-36" href="#Footnote_II-36" class="fnanchor">[II-36]</a>], which he supposed to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
great resemblance to an island opposite the mouth of the
above river; but finally he concluded it was not the island
and returned to camp. But this was actually the [RiviÃ¨re
de Corbeau or Crow Wing] river, as we discovered when we
got to the head of the island, from which we could see
the river's entrance. This fact exposes the ignorance and
inattention of the French and traders, and, with the exception
of a few intelligent men, what little confidence is to be
placed on their information. We ascended the Mississippi
about five miles above the confluence; found it not frozen,
but in many places not more than 100 yards over, mild and
still; it had indeed all the appearance of a small river of
a low country. Returned and found that my party, having
broken sleds, etc., had only made good three miles, while
I had marched 35.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 22d.</i> Killed three deer. Owing to the
many difficult places we had to pass, made but 4Â½ miles.</p>

<p><i>Dec. 23d.</i> Never did I undergo more fatigue, performing
the duties of hunter, spy, guide, commanding officer, etc.,
sometimes in front, sometimes in the rear, frequently in advance
of my party 10 or 15 miles. At night I was scarcely
able to make my notes intelligible. Killed two raccoons.
From our sleds breaking down, and having to make so
many portages on the road, made but four miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-37" id="FNanchor_II-37" href="#Footnote_II-37" class="fnanchor">[II-37]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dec. 24th.</i> Took the latitude of the Isle de Corbeau, and
found it to be in 45Â° 49Â´ 50Â´Â´ N. [It is above 46Â°.] The
Mississippi becomes very narrow above the river De Corbeau;
and, as if it were the forks, changes its direction from hard
W. [read N.] to N. E. generally.<a name="FNanchor_II-38" id="FNanchor_II-38" href="#Footnote_II-38" class="fnanchor">[II-38]</a> Distance 10Â½ miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-39" id="FNanchor_II-39" href="#Footnote_II-39" class="fnanchor">[II-39]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 25th.</i> Marched, and encamped at eleven o'clock.
Gave out two pounds of extra meat, two pounds of extra
flour, one gill of whisky, and some tobacco per man, in order
to distinguish Christmas Day. Distance three miles. [Not
quite to Brainerd yet.]</p>

<p><i>Dec. 26th.</i> Broke four sleds, broke into the river four
times, and had four carrying-places, since we left the river
De Corbeau. The timber was all yellow and pitch pine, of
which there were scarcely any below. Distance three miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-40" id="FNanchor_II-40" href="#Footnote_II-40" class="fnanchor">[II-40]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 27th.</i> After two carrying-places we arrived where
the river was completely closed with ice; after which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
proceeded with some degree of speed and ease. Killed one
bear. The country on both sides presented a dreary and
barren prospect of high rocks, with dead pine timber. Snow.
Distance 10 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-41" id="FNanchor_II-41" href="#Footnote_II-41" class="fnanchor">[II-41]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 28th.</i> Two sleds fell through the ice. In the morning
passed a very poor country with bare knobs on each
side; but toward evening the bottoms became larger and
the pine ridges better timbered. Bradley and myself
marched 10 miles beyond the sleds. Killed one deer.
Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-42" id="FNanchor_II-42" href="#Footnote_II-42" class="fnanchor">[II-42]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Dec. 29th.</i> Cold, windy day. Met with no material
interruptions; passed some rapids. The snow blew from
the woods on to the river. The country was full of small
lakes, some three miles in circumference. Distance 21 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-43" id="FNanchor_II-43" href="#Footnote_II-43" class="fnanchor">[II-43]</a></p>

<p><i>Dec. 30th.</i> The snow having drifted on the ice retarded
the sleds. Numerous small lakes and pine ridges continued.
A new species of pine, called the French sap pine. Killed
one otter [<i>Lutra canadensis</i>]. Distance 12 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-44" id="FNanchor_II-44" href="#Footnote_II-44" class="fnanchor">[II-44]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dec. 31st.</i> Passed Pine<a name="FNanchor_II-45" id="FNanchor_II-45" href="#Footnote_II-45" class="fnanchor">[II-45]</a> river about eleven o'clock. At
its mouth there was a Chipeway's encampment of 15 lodges;
this had been occupied in the summer, but was now vacant.
By the significations of their marks we understood that they
had marched a party of 50 warriors against the Sioux, and
had killed four men and four women, which were represented
by images carved out of pine or cedar. The four
men were painted and put in the ground to the middle,
leaving above ground those parts which are generally concealed;
by their sides were four painted poles, sharpened at
the end to represent the women. Near this were poles with
deerskins, plumes, silk handkerchiefs, etc.; also, a circular
hoop of cedar with something attached, representing a scalp.
Near each lodge they had holes dug in the ground, and
boughs ready to cover them, as a retreat for their women
and children if attacked by the Sioux.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Jan. 1st, 1806.</i> Passed on the bank of the
river [1 m. above Dean brook] six very elegant bark canoes,
which had been laid up by the Chipeways; also, a camp
which we conceived to have been evacuated about ten days.
My interpreter came after me in a great hurry, conjuring me
not to go so far ahead, and assured me that the Chipeways,
encountering me without an interpreter, party, or flag,
would certainly kill me. Notwithstanding this I went on
several miles further than usual, in order to make any discoveries
that were to be made; conceiving the savages not
so barbarous or ferocious as to fire on two men (I had one
with me) who were apparently coming into their country,
trusting to their generosity; and knowing that if we met
only two or three we were equal to them, I having my gun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
and pistols and he his buck-shot. Made some extra presents
for New Year's Day.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 2d.</i> Fine warm day. Discovered fresh sign of
Indians. Just as we were encamping at night, my sentinel
informed us that some Indians were coming full speed upon
our trail or track. I ordered my men to stand by their
guns carefully. They were immediately at my camp, and
saluted the flag by a discharge of three pieces; when four
Chipeways, one Englishman, and a Frenchman of the
N. W. Company, presented themselves. They informed us
that some women, having discovered our trail, gave the
alarm, and not knowing but it was their enemies, they had
departed to make a discovery. They had heard of us and
revered our flag. Mr. [Cuthbert?] Grant, the Englishman,
had only arrived the day before from Lake De Sable [Sandy
lake], from which he had marched in one day and a half.
I presented the Indians with half a deer, which they
received thankfully, for they had discovered our fires some
days ago, and believing it to be the Sioux, they dared not
leave their camp. They returned, but Mr. Grant remained
all night.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 3d.</i> My party marched early, but I returned with
Mr. Grant to his establishment on [Lower] Red Cedar
Lake, having one corporal with me. When we came in
sight of his house I observed the flag of Great Britain
flying. I felt indignant, and cannot say what my feelings
would have excited me to do, had he not informed me that
it belonged to the Indians. This was not much more
agreeable to me. After explaining to a Chipeway warrior
called Curly Head [Curleyhead in text of 1807, p. 33<a name="FNanchor_II-46" id="FNanchor_II-46" href="#Footnote_II-46" class="fnanchor">[II-46]</a>] the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
object of my voyage, and receiving his answer that he
would remain tranquil until my return, we ate a good breakfast
for the country, departed, and overtook my sleds just
at dusk. Killed one porcupine. Distance 16 miles.<a name="FNanchor_II-47" id="FNanchor_II-47" href="#Footnote_II-47" class="fnanchor">[II-47]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 4th.</i> We made 28 points<a name="FNanchor_II-48" id="FNanchor_II-48" href="#Footnote_II-48" class="fnanchor">[II-48]</a> in the river; broad, good
bottom, and of the usual timber. In the night I was
awakened by the cry of the sentinel, calling repeatedly to
the men; at length he vociferated, "G&mdash;d d&mdash;n your souls,
will you let the lieutenant be burned to death?" This
immediately aroused me. At first I seized my arms, but
looking round I saw my tents in flames. The men flew to
my assistance and we tore them down, but not until they
were entirely ruined. This, with the loss of my leggins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
mockinsons, socks, etc., which I had hung up to dry, was no
trivial misfortune, in such a country and on such a voyage.
But I had reason to thank God that the powder, three small
casks of which I had in my tent, did not take fire; if it had
I must certainly have lost all my baggage, if not my life.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 5th.</i> Mr. Grant promised to overtake me
yesterday, but has not yet arrived. I conceived it would
be necessary to attend his motions with careful observation.

<p><i>Jan. 6th.</i> Bradley and myself walked up 31 points, in
hopes to discover Lake De Sable [Sandy lake]; but finding
a near cut of 20 yards for 10 [two?] miles, and being fearful
the sleds would miss it, we returned 23 points before we
found our camp. They had made only eight points. Met
two Frenchmen of the N. W. Company with about 180
[qu. 80?] pounds on each of their backs, with rackets [snowshoes]
on; they informed me that Mr. Grant had gone on
with the Frenchman. Snow fell all day and was three feet
deep. Spent a miserable night.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 7th.</i> Made but 11 miles, and then were obliged to
send ahead and make fires every three miles; notwithstanding
which the cold was so intense that some of the men had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
their noses, others their fingers, and others their toes frozen,
before they felt the cold sensibly. Very severe day's march.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 8th.</i> Conceiving I was at no great distance from
Sandy Lake, I left my sleds, and with Corporal Bradley took
my departure for that place, intending to send him back the
same evening. We walked on very briskly until near night,
when we met a young Indian, one of those who had visited
my camp near [Lower] Red Cedar Lake. I endeavored to
explain to him that it was my wish to go to Lake De Sable
that evening. He returned with me until we came to a trail
that led across the woods; this he signified was a near
course. I went this course with him, and shortly after
found myself at a Chipeway encampment, to which I believe
the friendly savage had enticed me with an expectation that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
I would tarry all night, knowing that it was too late for us
to make the lake in good season. But upon our refusing to
stay, he put us in the right road. We arrived at the place
where the track left the Mississippi, at dusk, when we traversed
about two leagues of a wilderness, without any very great
difficulty, and at length struck the shore of Lake De Sable,
over a branch of which our course lay. The snow having
covered the trail made by the Frenchmen who had passed
before with the rackets, I was fearful of losing ourselves on
the lake; the consequence of which can only be conceived
by those who have been exposed on a lake, or naked plain,
a dreary night of January, in latitude 47Â° and the thermometer
below zero. Thinking that we could observe the bank
of the other shore, we kept a straight course, some time
after discovered lights, and on our arrival were not a little
surprised to find a large stockade. The gate being open,
we entered and proceeded to the quarters of Mr. Grant,
where we were treated with the utmost hospitality.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 9th.</i> Marched the corporal [back] early, in order
that our men should receive assurances of our safety and
success. He carried with him a small keg of spirits, a present
from Mr. Grant. The establishment of this place was
formed 12 years since by the N. W. Company, and was formerly
under the charge of a Mr. Charles Brusky [Bousquai<a name="FNanchor_II-50" id="FNanchor_II-50" href="#Footnote_II-50" class="fnanchor">[II-50]</a>].
It has attained at present such regularity as to permit
the superintendent to live tolerably comfortable. They
have horses procured from Red river of the Indians; raise
plenty of Irish potatoes; catch pike, suckers, pickerel, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
white-fish in abundance. They have also beaver, deer, and
moose; but the provision they chiefly depend upon is wild
oats, of which they purchase great quantities from the savages,
giving at the rate of about $1.50 per bushel. But
flour, pork, and salt are almost interdicted to persons not
principals in the trade. Flour sells at 50 cts.; salt, $1; pork,
80 cts.; sugar, 50 cts.; coffee, &mdash;&mdash;, and tea, $4.50 per
pound. The sugar is obtained from the Indians, and is
made from the maple tree.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 10th.</i> Mr. Grant accompanied me to the Mississippi
to mark the place for my boats to leave that river. This
was the first time I marched on rackets. I took the course
of [Sandy] Lake river, from its mouth to the lake. Mr.
Grant fell through the ice with his rackets on, and could not
have got out without assistance.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 11th.</i> Remained all day within quarters.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 12th</i>. Went out and met my men about 16
miles. A tree had fallen on one of them and hurt him very
much, which induced me to dismiss a sled and put the lading
on the others.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 13th.</i> After encountering much difficulty, we [the
main party] arrived at the establishment of the N. W. Company
on Lake de Sable, a little before night. The ice being
very bad on [Sandy] Lake river, owing to the many springs
and marshes, one sled fell through. My men had an excellent
room furnished them, and were presented with potatoes
and fille (cant term for a dram of spirits). Mr. Grant had
gone to an Indian lodge to receive his credits.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 14th.</i> Crossed the lake to the north side, that I
might take an observation; found the lat. 46Â° 9Â´ 20Â´Â´ N. [it is
about 46Â° 46Â´]. Surveyed that part of the lake. Mr. Grant
returned from the Indian lodges. They brought a quantity
of furs and 11 beaver carcases.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 15th.</i> Mr. Grant and myself made the tour of the
lake, with two men whom I had for attendants. Found it
to be much larger than could be imagined at a view. My
men sawed stocks for the sleds, which I found it necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
to construct after the manner of the country. On our
march met an Indian coming into the fort; his countenance
expressed no little astonishment when told who I was and
whence I came; for the people in this country themselves
acknowledge that the savages hold the Americans in greater
veneration than any other white people. They say of us,
when alluding to warlike achievements, that we "are neither
Frenchmen nor Englishmen, but white Indians."</p>

<p><i>Jan. 16th.</i> Laid down Lake De Sable, etc. A young
Indian whom I had engaged to go as a guide to Lake Sang
Sue [Leech Lake], arrived from the woods.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 17th.</i> Employed in making sleds, or <i>traineaux de
glace</i>, after the manner of the country. Those sleds are
made of a single plank turned up at one end like a fiddlehead,
and the baggage is lashed on in bags and sacks. Two
other Indians arrived from the woods. Engaged in writing.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 18th.</i> Busy in preparing my baggage for my departure
for Leech Lake, reading, etc.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 19th.</i> Employed as yesterday. Two men
of the N. W. Company arrived from Fond du Lac Superior
with letters, one of which was from their establishment in
Athapuscow [Athapasca], and had been since last May on
the route. While at this post I ate roasted beavers, dressed
in every respect as a pig is usually dressed with us; it was
excellent. I could not discern the least taste of Des Bois
[<i>i. e.</i>, of the wood on which beavers feed]. I also ate boiled
moose's head: when well boiled, I consider it equal to the
tail of the beaver; in taste and substance they are much
alike.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 20th.</i> The men with the sleds took their departure
about two o'clock. Shortly after I followed them. We encamped
at the portage between the Mississippi and Leech
Lake [<i>i. e.</i>, Willow<a name="FNanchor_II-51" id="FNanchor_II-51" href="#Footnote_II-51" class="fnanchor">[II-51]</a>] river. Snow fell in the night.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 21st.</i> Snowed in the morning, but we crossed [Willow
portage] about nine o'clock. I had gone on a few
points when I was overtaken by Mr. Grant, who informed
me that the sleds could not get along, in consequence of
water being on the ice [of Willow river]; he sent his men
forward. We returned and met the sleds, which had
scarcely advanced one mile. We unloaded them and sent
eight men back to the post [on Sandy lake] with whatever
might be denominated extra articles; but in the hurry sent
my salt and ink. Mr. Grant encamped with me and marched
early in the morning [of the 22d].</p>

<p><i>Jan. 22d.</i> Made a pretty good day's journey. My Indian
came up about noon. Distance 20 miles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jan. 23d.</i> Marched about 18 miles. Forgot my thermometer,
having hung it on a tree; sent Boley back five
miles for it. My young Indian and myself killed eight
partridges; took him to live with me.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 24th.</i> At our encampment this night Mr. Grant had
encamped on the night of the same day he left me; it was
three days' march for us. In the evening the father of his
girl came to my camp and stayed all night; he appeared
very friendly and was very communicative; but having no
interpreter, we made but little progress in conversation. It
was late before the men came up.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 25th.</i> Traveled almost all day through the lands,
and found them much better than usual. Boley lost the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Sioux pipestem which I carried along for the purpose of
making peace with the Chipeways; I sent him back for it;
he did not return until eleven o'clock at night. It was very
warm; thawing all day. Distance 44 points.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 26th.</i> I left my party in order to proceed
to a house or lodge of Mr. Grant's on the Mississippi [opposite
Grand Rapids], where he was to tarry until I overtook
him. Took with me my Indian, Boley, and some trifling
provision; the Indian and myself marched so fast that we
left Boley on the route about eight miles from the lodge.
Met Mr. Grant's men on their return to Lake De Sable,
they having evacuated the house this morning, and Mr.
Grant having marched [thence] for Leech Lake. The
Indian and I arrived before sundown [at Grant's house<a name="FNanchor_II-52" id="FNanchor_II-52" href="#Footnote_II-52" class="fnanchor">[II-52]</a>].
Passed the night very uncomfortably, having nothing to eat,
not much wood, nor any blankets. The Indian slept sound.
I cursed his insensibility, being obliged to content myself
over a few coals all night. Boley did not arrive. In the
night the Indian mentioned something about his son, etc.</p>

<p><i>Monday, Jan. 27th.</i> My Indian rose early, mended his
mockinsons, then expressed by signs something about his son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and the Frenchman we met yesterday. Conceiving that he
wished to send some message to his family, I suffered him to
depart. After his departure I felt the curse of solitude,
although he truly was no company. Boley arrived about ten
o'clock. He said that he had followed us until some time in
the night; when, believing that he could not overtake us, he
stopped and made a fire; but having no ax to cut wood, he
was near freezing. He met the Indians, who made him signs
to go on. I spent the day in putting my gun in order,
mending my mockinsons, etc. Provided plenty of wood;
still found it cold, with but one blanket.</p>

<p>I can only account for the gentlemen of the N. W. Company
contenting themselves in this wilderness for 10, 15,
and some of them for 20 years, by the attachment they contract
for the Indian women. It appears to me that the
wealth of nations would not induce me to remain secluded
from the society of civilized mankind, surrounded by a
savage and unproductive wilderness, without books or other
sources of intellectual enjoyment, or being blessed with the
cultivated and feeling mind of a civilized fair [one].</p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Jan. 28th.</i> [My party joined Boley and myself
at Grant's house to-day. <i>Wednesday, Jan. 29th.</i><a name="FNanchor_II-53" id="FNanchor_II-53" href="#Footnote_II-53" class="fnanchor">[II-53]</a> Took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Miller and proceeded ahead of my party; reached Pakagama
falls about one o'clock; proceeded to three deserted
Chipeway lodges; found a fine parcel of firewood split;
cut down three sap pines and wove the branches into one
of the lodges to protect ourselves from the storm; had
a tolerable night. <i>Thursday, Jan. 30th.</i> Miller and myself]
left our encampment at a good hour; unable to find any
trail, passed through one of the most dismal cypress swamps
I ever saw, and struck the Mississippi at a small lake. Observed
Mr. Grant's tracks going through it; found his mark
of a cut-off, agreed on between us; took it, and proceeded
very well until we came to a small lake where the trail was
entirely hid. But after some search on the other side, found
it; when we passed through a dismal swamp, on the other
side of which we found a large lake at which I was entirely
at a loss; no trail was to be seen. Struck a [White Oak<a name="FNanchor_II-54" id="FNanchor_II-54" href="#Footnote_II-54" class="fnanchor">[II-54]</a>]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
point about three miles, where we found a Chipeway lodge
of one man, his wife, five children, and one old woman.
They received us with every mark that distinguished their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
barbarity, such as setting their dogs on ours, trying to thrust
their hands into our pockets, etc. But we convinced them
that we were not afraid, and let them know we were Chewockomen<a name="FNanchor_II-55" id="FNanchor_II-55" href="#Footnote_II-55" class="fnanchor">[II-55]</a>
(Americans), when they used us more civilly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>After we had arranged a camp as well as possible, I went
into the lodge; they presented me with a plate of dried
meat. I ordered Miller to bring about two gills of
liquor, which made us all good friends. The old squaw
gave me more meat, and offered me tobacco, which, not
using, I did not take. I gave her an order upon my corporal
for one knife and half a carrot of tobacco. Heaven
clothes the lilies and feeds the ravens, and the same almighty
Providence protects and preserves these creatures. After I
had gone out to my fire, the old man came out and proposed
to trade beaver-skins for whisky; meeting with a refusal, he
left me; when presently the old woman came out with a
beaver-skin; she also being refused, he returned to the
charge with a quantity of dried meat, which, or any other,
I should have been glad to have had. I gave him a peremptory
refusal; then all further application ceased. It
really appeared that with one quart of whisky I might have
bought all they possessed. Night remarkably cold; was
obliged to sit up nearly the whole of it. Suffered much
with cold and from want of sleep.</p>

<p><i>Friday, Jan. 31st.</i> Took my clothes into the Indian's lodge
to dress, and was received very coolly; but by giving him a
dram unasked, and his wife a little salt, I received from
them directions for my route. Passed the lake or morass,
and opened on meadows through which the Mississippi
winds its course of nearly 15 miles long. Took a straight
course through them to the head, when I found we had
missed the river; made a turn of about two miles and
regained it. Passed a fork which I supposed to be [that
coming from] Lake Winipie [or Winipeque, <i>i. e.</i>, the
main Mississippi river coming from Lake Winnibigoshish],
making the course N. W. The branch we took was Leech
Lake branch, course S. W. and W. Passed a very large
meadow or prairie, course W.<a name="FNanchor_II-56" id="FNanchor_II-56" href="#Footnote_II-56" class="fnanchor">[II-56]</a> The [Leech Lake branch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of the] Mississippi is only 15 yards wide. Encamped
about one mile below the traverse of the meadow.</p>

<p>Saw a very large animal which, from its leaps, I supposed
to have been a panther; but if so, it was twice as large as
those on the lower Mississippi. He evinced some disposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
to approach. I lay down (Miller being in the rear) in
order to entice him to come near, but he would not. The
night was remarkably cold. Some spirits which I had in a
small keg congealed to the consistency of honey.

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">
ITINERARY, CONCLUDED: LEECH LAKE TO ST. LOUIS,
FEBRUARY 1ST-APRIL 30TH, 1806.</span></h2>

<p>Saturday, Feb. 1st. Left our camp pretty early.
Passed a continued train of prairie, and arrived at
Lake La Sang Sue [Leech lake] at half-past two o'clock. I
will not attempt to describe my feelings on the accomplishment
of my voyage, for this is [what was then mistaken to
be] the main source of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_III-1" id="FNanchor_III-1" href="#Footnote_III-1" class="fnanchor">[III-1]</a> The Lake Winipie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
branch is navigable thence to [Upper] Red Cedar [now
Cass] lake, for the distance of five leagues, which is [very
far from being] the extremity of the navigation. Crossed
the lake 12 miles to the establishment of the N. W. Company,
where we arrived about three o'clock [10 o'clock,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
p. m.]; found all the gates locked, but upon knocking were
admitted, and received with marked attention and hospitality
by Mr. Hugh M'Gillis. Had a good dish of coffee,
biscuit, butter, and cheese for supper.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 2d.</i> Remained all day within doors. In the
evening sent an invitation to Mr. [George] Anderson, who
was an agent of Dickson, and also for some young Indians
at his house, to come over and breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 3d.</i> Spent the day in reading Volney's Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_III-2" id="FNanchor_III-2" href="#Footnote_III-2" class="fnanchor">[III-2]</a>
proposing some queries to Mr. Anderson, and preparing my
young man [Miller] to return with a supply of provisions to
my party.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 4th.</i> Miller departed this morning. Mr. Anderson
returned to his quarters. My legs and ankles were so much
swelled that I was not able to wear my own clothes and
was obliged to borrow some from Mr. M'Gillis.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 5th.</i> One of Mr. M'Gillis' clerks [Roussand or
Boussant<a name="FNanchor_III-3" id="FNanchor_III-3" href="#Footnote_III-3" class="fnanchor">[III-3]</a>] had been sent to some Indian lodges and
expected to return in four days, but had now been absent
nine. Mr. Grant was dispatched in order to find out what
had become of him.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 6th.</i> My men arrived at the fort about four o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_III-4" id="FNanchor_III-4" href="#Footnote_III-4" class="fnanchor">[III-4]</a>
Mr. M'Gillis asked if I had any objections to his hoisting
their [British] flag in compliment to ours. I made none, as
I had not yet explained to him my ideas. In making a
traverse of the lake, some of my men had their ears, some
their noses, and others their chins frozen.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 7th.</i> Remained within doors, my limbs being still
very much swelled. Addressed a letter to Mr. M'Gillis on
the subject of the N. W. Company trade in this quarter.<a name="FNanchor_III-5" id="FNanchor_III-5" href="#Footnote_III-5" class="fnanchor">[III-5]</a></p>

<p><i>Feb. 8th.</i> Took the latitude and found it to be 47Â° 16Â´ 13Â´Â´.
Shot with our rifles.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 9th.</i> Mr. M'Gillis and myself paid a visit to
Mr. Anderson, an agent of Mr. Dickson of the Lower Mississippi,
who resided at the west end of the lake.<a name="FNanchor_III-6" id="FNanchor_III-6" href="#Footnote_III-6" class="fnanchor">[III-6]</a> Found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
him eligibly situated as to trade, but his houses bad. I
rode in a cariole for one person, constructed in the following
manner: Boards planed smooth, turned up in front about
two feet, coming to a point, and about 2Â½ feet wide
behind; on which is fixed a box covered with dressed
skins painted; this box is open at the top, but covered in
front about two-thirds of the length. The horse is fastened
between the shafts. The rider wraps himself up in a buffalo-robe
and sits flat down, having a cushion to lean his back
against. Thus accoutered, with a fur cap, etc., he may bid
defiance to the wind and weather. Upon our return we
found that some of the Indians had already returned from
the hunting-camps; also, Monsieur Roussand [Mr. M'Gillis'
clerk of Feb. 5th], the gentleman supposed to have been
killed by the Indians. His arrival with Mr. Grant diffused
a general satisfaction through the fort.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 10th.</i> Hoisted the American flag in the fort. The
English yacht [Jack] still flying at the top of the flagstaff,
I directed the Indians and my riflemen to shoot at it.
They soon broke the iron pin to which it was fastened, and
brought it to the ground. Reading Shenstone, etc.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 11th.</i> The Sweet, Buck, Burnt, etc., arrived, all
chiefs of note, but the former in particular, a venerable old
man.<a name="FNanchor_III-7" id="FNanchor_III-7" href="#Footnote_III-7" class="fnanchor">[III-7]</a> From him I learned that the Sioux occupied this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
ground when, to use his own phrase, "he was a made man
and began to hunt; that they occupied it the year that the
French missionaries were killed at the river Pacagama."
The Indians flocked in.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 12th.</i> Bradley and myself, with Mr. M'Gillis and
two of his men, left Leech Lake at ten o'clock, and arrived
at the house at [Upper] Red Cedar [now Cass<a name="FNanchor_III-8" id="FNanchor_III-8" href="#Footnote_III-8" class="fnanchor">[III-8]</a>] Lake, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158-164</a></span>
sunset, a distance of 30 miles. My ankles were very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
swelled and I was very lame. From the entrance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
Mississippi to the streight is called six miles, S. W. course.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
Thence to the south end, S. 30 E. four miles. The bay at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a></span>
the entrance extends nearly E. and W. six miles; it is about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
2Â½ from the north side to a large point. This may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a></span>
called the upper source of the Mississippi, being 15 miles
above Little Lake Winipie [<i>i. e.</i>, Lake Winnibigoshish];
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165-167</a></span>
and the extent of canoe navigation only two leagues to some
of the Hudson's Bay waters.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 13th.</i> Were favored with a beautiful day. Took the
latitude, and found it to be 47Â° 42Â´ 40Â´Â´ N. At this place it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
was that Mr. Thompson<a name="FNanchor_III-9" id="FNanchor_III-9" href="#Footnote_III-9" class="fnanchor">[III-9]</a> made his observations in 1798,
from which he determined that the source of the Mississippi
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
was in 47Â° 38Â´. I walked about three miles back in the
country, at two-thirds water. One of our men marched to
Lake Winepie [<i>i. e.</i>, Lake Winnibigoshish] and returned by
one o'clock, for the stem of the Sweet's pipe, a matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
more consequence in his affairs with the Sioux than the
diploma of many an ambassador. We feasted on whitefish
[<i>Coregonus</i> sp.], roasted on two iron grates fixed horizontally
in the back of the chimney; the entrails left in the
fish.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 14th.</i> Left the house at nine o'clock. It becomes
me here to do justice to the hospitality of our hosts: one
Roy, a Canadian, and his wife, a Chipeway squaw. They
relinquished for our use the only thing in the house that
could be called a bed, attended us like servants, nor could
either of them be persuaded to touch a mouthful until we
had finished our repasts. We made the [Leech Lake] garrison
about sundown, having been drawn at least 10 miles
in a sleigh by two small dogs. They were loaded with 200
pounds, and went so fast as to render it difficult for the men
with snowshoes to keep up with them. The chiefs asked
my permission to dance the calumet-dance, which I granted.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 15th.</i> The Flat Mouth,<a name="FNanchor_III-10" id="FNanchor_III-10" href="#Footnote_III-10" class="fnanchor">[III-10]</a> chief of the Leech Lake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170-171</a></span>
village, and many other Indians arrived. Received a letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a></span>
from Mr. M'Gillis.<a name="FNanchor_III-11" id="FNanchor_III-11" href="#Footnote_III-11" class="fnanchor">[III-11]</a> Noted down the heads of my speech,
and had it translated into French, in order that the interpreter
should be perfectly master of his subject.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 16th.</i> Held a council with the chiefs and
warriors of this place and of Red Lake; but it required
much patience, coolness, and management to obtain the
objects I desired, viz.: That they should make peace with
the Sioux; deliver up their [British] medals and flags; and
that some of their chiefs should follow me to St. Louis.<a name="FNanchor_III-12" id="FNanchor_III-12" href="#Footnote_III-12" class="fnanchor">[III-12]</a>
As a proof of their agreeing to the peace, I directed that
they should smoke out of the [Sioux chief] Wabasha's pipe,
which lay on the table; they all smoked, from the head
chief to the youngest soldier. They generally delivered up
their flags with a good grace, except Flat Mouth, who said
he had left both at his camp, three days' march, and promised
to deliver them up to Mr. M'Gillis to be forwarded.
With respect to their returning with me, old Sweet thought
it most proper to return to the Indians of Red lake, Red
river, and Rainy Lake river. Flat Mouth said it was necessary
for him to restrain his young warriors, etc. The other
chiefs did not think themselves of sufficient consequence to
offer any reason for not following me to St. Louis, a journey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
of between 2,000 and 3,000 miles through hostile tribes of
Indians. I then told them, "that I was sorry to find that
the hearts of the Sauteurs of this quarter were so weak;
that the other nations would say, 'What! were there no soldiers
at Leech, Red, and Rainy Lakes who had the hearts to
carry the calumet of their chief to their father?'" This had
the desired effect. The Bucks and Beaux [<i>sic</i>&mdash;both pl.],
two of the most celebrated young warriors, rose and offered
themselves to me for the embassy; they were accepted,
adopted as my children, and I was installed their father.
Their example animated the others, and it would have been
no difficult matter to have taken a company; two, however,
were sufficient. I determined that it should be my care
never to make them regret the noble confidence placed in
me; for I would have protected their lives with my own.
Beaux is brother to Flat Mouth. Gave my new soldiers a
dance and a small dram. They attempted to get more
liquor, but a firm and peremptory denial convinced them I
was not to be trifled with.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 17th.</i> The chief of the land<a name="FNanchor_III-13" id="FNanchor_III-13" href="#Footnote_III-13" class="fnanchor">[III-13]</a> brought in his flag
and delivered it up. Made arrangements to march my
party the next day. Instructed Sweet how to send the
parole to the Indians of Red river, etc. Put my men
through the manual, and fired three blank rounds, all of
which not a little astonished the Indians. I was obliged to
give my two new soldiers each a blanket, pair of leggins,
scissors, and looking-glass.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 18th.</i> We<a name="FNanchor_III-14" id="FNanchor_III-14" href="#Footnote_III-14" class="fnanchor">[III-14]</a> marched for [Lower] Red Cedar Lake
about eleven o'clock, with a guide provided for me by Mr.
M'Gillis; were all provided with snowshoes. Marched off
amid the acclamations and shouts of the Indians, who
generally had remained to see us take our departure. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Anderson promised to come on with letters; he arrived
about twelve o'clock and remained all night. He concluded
to go down with me to see Mr. Dickson.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 19th.</i> Bradley, Mr. L'Rone [?], the two young
Indians [Buck and Beau], and myself, left Mr. M'Gillis' at
ten o'clock; crossed Leech Lake in a S. E. direction 24
miles. Mr. M'Gillis' hospitality deserves to be particularly
noticed; he presented me with his dogs and cariole, valued
in this country at $200. One of the dogs broke out of his
harness, and we were not able during that day to catch him
again; the other poor fellow was obliged to pull the whole
load&mdash;at least 150 pounds. This day's march was from lake
to lake.<a name="FNanchor_III-15" id="FNanchor_III-15" href="#Footnote_III-15" class="fnanchor">[III-15]</a></p>

<p><i>Feb. 20th.</i> I allowed my men to march at least three
hours before me; notwithstanding which, as it was cold and
the road good, my sleigh dogs brought me ahead of all by
one o'clock. Halted for an encampment at half past two
o'clock. Our courses this day were S. E. six miles, then
S. 18 miles, almost all the way over lakes, some of which
were six miles across. Encamped on the bank of a lake
called Sandy Lake.<a name="FNanchor_III-16" id="FNanchor_III-16" href="#Footnote_III-16" class="fnanchor">[III-16]</a> Indians were out hunting.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p><i>Feb. 21st.</i> Traveled this day generally S. Passed but
two lakes; Sandy Lake, which is of an oblong form, N. and
S. four miles, and one other small one. The Indians, at the
instigation of Mr. L'Rone, applied for him to accompany
us. I consented that he should go as far as [Lower] Red
Cedar Lake. I then wrote a note to M'Gillis upon the occasion.
After Reale had departed with it, L'Rone disclosed
to me that it was his wish to desert the N. W. Company
entirely, and accompany me. To have countenanced for
a moment anything of this kind, I conceived would have
been inconsistent with every principle of honor; I therefore
obliged him to return immediately. We then had no guide,
our Indians not knowing the road. Our course was through
woods and bad brush, 15 miles.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 22d.</i> Our course a little to the S. of E., through
woods not very thick. Arrived at White Fish Lake<a name="FNanchor_III-17" id="FNanchor_III-17" href="#Footnote_III-17" class="fnanchor">[III-17]</a> at
eleven o'clock, and took an observation. My party crossed
this lake and encamped between two lakes. This may be
called the source of Pine river. At this place has been one
of the N. W. Company's establishments at the N. E. and
S. side. It was a square stockade of about 50 feet, but at
this time nearly all consumed by fire. Also one standing
over the point on the E. side.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Feb. 23d.</i> My two Indians, Boley, and myself,
with my sleigh and dogs, left the party under an idea that
we should make [Lower] Red Cedar lake. We marched
hard all day, without arriving at the Mississippi. Our course
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
was nearly due east until near night, when we changed more
south. Took no provision or bedding. My Indians killed
15 partridges, some nearly black, with a red mark over their
eyes, called the savanna partridge [Canada grouse or spruce
partridge, <i>Dendragapus canadensis</i>]. Overtaken about
noon by two of Mr. Anderson's men, named Brurie and
[Blank], Mr. Anderson himself not being able to come.
Distance 30 miles.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 24th.</i> We started early, and after passing over one
of the worst roads in the world, found ourselves on a lake
about three o'clock; took its outlet [Dean creek] and struck
the Mississippi about one mile below the [Chippewa]
canoes mentioned on Jan. 1st, by which I knew where we
were. Ascended the Mississippi about four miles, and encamped
on the west side [about the mouth of Hay creek<a name="FNanchor_III-18" id="FNanchor_III-18" href="#Footnote_III-18" class="fnanchor">[III-18]</a>].
Our general course this day was nearly S., when it should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
have been S. E. My young warriors were still in good
heart, singing and showing every wish to keep me so. The
pressure of my racket-strings brought the blood through
my socks and mockinsons, from which the pain I marched
in may be imagined.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 25th.</i> We marched and arrived at [Lower Red] Cedar
lake before noon; found Mr. Grant and De Breche, chief of
Sandy lake [Chippewas<a name="FNanchor_III-19" id="FNanchor_III-19" href="#Footnote_III-19" class="fnanchor">[III-19]</a>] at the house. This gave me much
pleasure, for I conceive Mr. Grant to be a gentleman of
as much candor as any with whom I made an acquaintance
in this quarter, and the chief, De Breche, is reputed to be a
man of better information than any [other] of the Sauteurs.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 26th.</i> Sent one of Mr. Grant's men down with a bag
of rice to meet my people; he found them encamped on
the Mississippi. Wrote a letter<a name="FNanchor_III-20" id="FNanchor_III-20" href="#Footnote_III-20" class="fnanchor">[III-20]</a> to Mr. Dickson on the
subject of the Fols Avoins [Folle Avoine or Menomonee
Indians]; also, some orders to my sergeant [Kennerman, at
the stockade on Swan river]. This evening I had a long conversation
with De Breche; he informed me that a string of
wampum had been sent among the Chipeways, he thought
by the British commanding officer at St. Joseph. He appeared
to be a very intelligent man.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 27th.</i> The chief called the White Fisher and seven
Indians arrived at the house. My men also arrived about
twelve o'clock.</p>

<p><i>Feb. 28th.</i> We left [Lower] Red Cedar lake about eleven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
o'clock, and went to where the canoes were [near Dean
creek], mentioned in my journal of Jan. 1st. My young Indians
[Buck and Beau] remained behind under the pretense
of waiting for the chief De Breche, who returned to Sandy
Lake for his [British] flag and medals, and was to render
himself at my post with Mr. Grant about the 15th of the
following month.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 1st.</i> Departed early. Passed our encampment of
Dec. 31st at nine o'clock. Passed Pine river at twelve
o'clock. Passed our encampment of Dec. 30th at three
o'clock. Passed our encampment of Dec. 29th just before
we came to our present, which we made on the point of the
Pine Ridge below. Distance 43 miles.<a name="FNanchor_III-21" id="FNanchor_III-21" href="#Footnote_III-21" class="fnanchor">[III-21]</a></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 2d.</i> Passed our encampment of Dec. 28th
at ten o'clock, that of Dec. 27th at one o'clock, and encamped
at that of Dec. 26th [Brainerd]. Found wood nearly sufficient
for our use. This morning dispatched Bradley to the
last place we had buried a barrel of flour [Dec. 20th, a short
distance below Crow Wing river], to thaw the ground and
hunt. This day a party of Indians struck the river behind
Bradley and before us, but left it 10 miles above Raven
[Crow Wing] river.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 3d.</i> Marched early; passed our Christmas encampment
at sunrise. I was ahead of my party in my cariole.
Soon afterward I observed a smoke on the W. shore.
I hallooed, and some Indians appeared on the bank. I
waited until my interpreter came up; we then went to the
camp. They proved to be a party of Chipeways, who had
left the encampment the same day we left it. They presented
me with some roast meat, which I gave my sleigh
dogs. They then left their camp and accompanied us
down the river. We passed our encampment of Dec. 24th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
at nine o'clock, of the 23d at ten o'clock, and of the 22d at
eleven o'clock; here the Indians crossed over to the W.
shore; arrived at the encampment of Dec. 21st at twelve
o'clock, where we had a barrel of flour [cached Dec. 20th,
short of Crow Wing river].</p>

<p>I here found Corporal Meek and another man from the
post [on Swan river], from whom I heard that the men
were all well; they confirmed the account of a Sioux having
fired on a sentinel; and added that the sentinel had first
made him drunk and then turned him out of the tent; upon
which he fired on the sentinel and ran off, but promised to
deliver himself up in the spring. The corporal informed
me that the sergeant [Kennerman] had used all the elegant
hams and saddles of venison which I had preserved to present
to the commander-in-chief and other friends; that he
had made away with all the whisky, including a keg I had
for my own use, having publicly sold it to the men, and
a barrel of pork; that he had broken open my trunk and
sold some things out of it, traded with the Indians, gave
them liquor, etc.; and this, too, contrary to my most
pointed and particular directions. Thus, after I had used
in going up the river with my party the strictest economy,
living upon two pounds of frozen venison a day, in order
that we might have provision to carry us down in the spring,
this fellow was squandering the flour, pork, and liquor during
the winter, while we were starving with hunger and
cold. I had saved all our corn, bacon, and the meat of six
deer, and left it at Sandy Lake, with some tents, my mess-boxes,
salt, tobacco, etc., all of which we were obliged to
sacrifice by not returning the same route we went; we had
consoled ourselves at this loss by the flattering idea that we
should find at our little post a handsome stock preserved&mdash;how
mortifying the disappointment!</p>

<p>We raised our barrel of flour and came down to the
mouth of the little [Nokasippi] river, on the E., which we
had passed on Dec. 21st. The ice covered with water.</p>

<p><i><a name="Mar4" id="Mar4">Mar. 4th</a>.</i> Proceeded early. Passed our encampment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Dec. 20th at sunrise. Arrived at that of the 19th [read
17th] at nine o'clock; here we had buried two barrels.<a name="FNanchor_III-22" id="FNanchor_III-22" href="#Footnote_III-22" class="fnanchor">[III-22]</a>
Made a large fire to thaw the ground. Went on the prairie
and found Sparks, one of my hunters, and brought him to
the river at the Pine Camp [of Dec. 14th, 15th, 16th, vicinity
of Olmsted's bar]. Passed on opposite our encampment
of Dec. 13th [at or near Topeka], and encamped where
Sparks and some men had an old hunting-camp, and where
Fresaie, a Chipeway chief, surrounded them.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 5th.</i> Passed all the encampments [Dec. 12th, 11th,
10th, 9th] between Pine creek and the post, at which
we arrived about ten o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_III-23" id="FNanchor_III-23" href="#Footnote_III-23" class="fnanchor">[III-23]</a> I sent a man on ahead to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
prevent the salute I had before ordered by letter [of Feb.
28th]; this I had done from the idea that the Sioux chiefs
would accompany me. Found all well. Confined my sergeant.
About one o'clock Mr. Dickson arrived, with Killeur
Rouge, his son, and two other Sioux men, with two
women who had come up to be introduced to the Sauteurs
they expected to find with me. Received a letter from
[Joseph] Reinville.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 6th.</i> Thomas [Carron<a name="FNanchor_III-24" id="FNanchor_III-24" href="#Footnote_III-24" class="fnanchor">[III-24]</a>], the Fols Avoin's first
chief, arrived with ten others of his nation. I made a
serious and authoritative expostulative representation to
him of my opinion of the conduct of Shawonoe, another
chief of his nation, who had behaved ill. Had also a conference
with Killeur Rouge and his people. At night wrote
to Messrs. Grant, M'Gillis, and Anderson.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 7th.</i> Held conversations with the Indians. Thomas
[Carron], the Fols Avoin chief, assured me that he would
interest himself in obliging the Puants to deliver up the men
who had recently committed murders on the Ouiscousing
and Rock rivers; and if necessary he would make it a
national quarrel, on the side of the Americans. This
Thomas is a fine fellow, of a very masculine figure, noble
and animated delivery, and appears to be very much attached
to the Americans. The Sioux informed me that
they would wait until I had determined my affairs in this
country, and then bear my words to the St. Peters.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 8th.</i> The Fols Avoin chief presented me with his
pipe to give to the Sauteurs on their arrival, with assurances
of their safety on their voyage, and his wish for them to descend
the river. The Fils de Killeur Rouge also presented
me with his pipe to present to the Sauteur Indians on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
arrival, to make them smoke, and assure them of his friendly
disposition, and that he would wait to see them at Mr.
Dickson's. Thomas made a formal complaint against a
Frenchman, by name Greignor,<a name="FNanchor_III-25" id="FNanchor_III-25" href="#Footnote_III-25" class="fnanchor">[III-25]</a> who resided in Green bay,
and who he said abused the Indians, beat them, etc., without
provocation. I promised to write to the commanding
officer or Indian agent at Michilimackinac upon the occasion.
The Indians with Mr. Dickson all took their departure.
Hitched my dogs in the sleigh, which drew one of the
Indian women down the ice, to the no little amusement of
the others. Went some distance down the river in order to
cut a mast. Cut a pine mast 35 feet long for my big boat
at the prairie [Prairie du Chien]. This day my little boy
broke the cock of my gun; few trifling misfortunes could
have happened which I should have regretted more, as the
wild fowl just began to return on the approach of spring.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 9th.</i> I examined into the conduct of my
sergeant, and found that he was guilty; punished him by
reduction, etc. Visited the Fols Avoin lodges and received
a present of some tallow. One of my men arrived from the
hunting-camp with two deer.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 10th.</i> Was visited by the Fols Avoin chief and
several others of his nation. This chief was an extraordinary
hunter; to instance his power, he killed 40 elk and a
bear in one day, chasing the former from dawn to eve. We
were all busied in preparing oars, guns, mast, etc., by the
time the ice broke up, which was opening fast.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 11th.</i> In a long conversation with a Reynard, he
professed not to believe in an hereafter; but he believed
that the world would all be drowned by water at some future
period; he asked how it was to be repeopled. In justice to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
his nation, however, I must observe that his opinion was
singular.<a name="FNanchor_III-26" id="FNanchor_III-26" href="#Footnote_III-26" class="fnanchor">[III-26]</a></p>

<p><i>Mar. 12th.</i> Made preparations; had a fine chase with
deer on the ice; killed one. Since our return I have received
eight deer from our camp.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 13th.</i> Received two deer from my hunting-camp.
Went out with my gun on the opposite side of the river.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Ascended the mountain which borders the prairie. On the
point of it I found a stone on which the Indians had sharpened
their knives, and a war-club half finished. From this
spot you may extend the eye over vast prairies with
scarcely any interruption but clumps of trees, which at a distance
appeared like mountains, from two or three of which
the smoke rising in the air denoted the habitation of the
wandering savage, and too often marked them out as victims
to their enemies; from whose cruelty I have had the
pleasure in the course of the winter and through a wilderness
of immense extent to relieve them, as peace has
reigned through my mediation from the prairie Des Cheins
to the lower Red river. If a subaltern with but 20 men, at
so great a distance from the seat of his government, could
effect so important a change in the minds of those savages,
what might not a great and independent power effect, if,
instead of blowing up the flames of discord, they exerted
their influence in the sacred cause of peace?</p>

<p>When I returned to the fort, I found the Fols Avoin
chief, who intended to remain all night. He told me that
near the conclusion of the Revolutionary War his nation
began to look upon him as a warrior; that they received a
parole from Michilimackinac, on which he was dispatched
with 40 warriors; and that on his arrival he was requested
to lead them against the Americans. To which he replied:
"We have considered you and the Americans as one people.
You are now at war; how are we to decide who has justice
on their side? Besides, you white people are like the leaves
on the trees for numbers. Should I march with my 40 warriors
to the field of battle, they with their chief would be
unnoticed in the multitude, and would be swallowed up
as the big water embosoms the small rivulets which
discharge themselves into it. No, I will return to my
nation, where my countrymen may be of service against
our red enemies, and their actions renowned in the dance
of our nation."</p>

<p><i>Mar. 14th.</i> Took the latitude by an artificial horizon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
and measured the river. Received one deer and a half from
my hunting-camp. Ice thinner.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 15th.</i> This was the day fixed upon by Mr. Grant
and the Chipeway warriors for their arrival at my fort. I
was all day anxiously expecting them, for I knew that
should they not accompany me down, the peace partially
effected between them and the Sioux would not be on a
permanent footing. Upon this I take them to be neither so
brave or generous as the Sioux, who in all their transactions
appear to be candid and brave, whereas the Chipeways are
suspicious, consequently treacherous and of course cowards.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 16th.</i> Received three deer from our hunting-camp.
Examined trees for canoes.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 17th.</i> Left the fort with my interpreter [Rousseau]
and [Private Alexander] Roy, in order to visit Thomas, the
Fols Avoin chief, who was encamped, with six lodges of his
nation, about 20 miles below us, on a little [Wolf creek of
Pike, now Spunk] river which empties into the Mississippi
on the W. side, a little above Clear river [of Pike, now the
Platte]. On our way down killed one goose, wounded
another, and a deer that the dogs had driven into an air-hole;
hung our game on the trees. Arrived at the creek;
took out on it; ascended three or four miles on one bank,
and descended on the other [missing Carron's camp both
ways]. Killed another goose. Struck the Mississippi below
[Spunk river]. Encamped at our encampment of the [13th]
of October, when we ascended the river. Ate our goose
for supper. It snowed all day, and at night a very severe
storm arose. It may be imagined that we spent a very disagreeable
night without shelter, and but one blanket each.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 18th.</i> We marched [up Spunk river], determined to
find the [Menomonee] lodges. Met an Indian whose track
we pursued through almost impenetrable woods for about
2Â½ miles to the camp. Here there was one of the finest
sugar-camps I almost ever saw, the whole of the timber
being sugar-tree. We were conducted to the chief's lodge,
who received us in patriarchal style. He pulled off my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
leggings and mockinsons, put me in the best place in his
lodge, and offered me dry clothes. He then presented us
with syrup of the maple to drink, and asked whether I preferred
eating beaver, swan, elk, or deer; upon my giving the
preference to the first, a large kettle was filled by his wife,
in which soup was made; this being thickened with flour, we
had what I then thought a delicious repast. After we had
refreshed ourselves, he asked whether we would visit his
people at the other lodges, which we did, and in each were
presented with something to eat; by some, with a bowl of
sugar; by others, a beaver's tail, etc. After making this
tour we returned to the chief's lodge, and found a berth
provided for each of us, of good soft bearskins nicely spread,
and on mine there was a large feather pillow.</p>

<p>I must not here omit to mention an anecdote which
serves to characterize more particularly their manners.
This in the eyes of the contracted moralist would deform
my hospitable host into a monster of libertinism; but by
a liberal mind would be considered as arising from the
hearty generosity of the wild savage. In the course of the
day, observing a ring on one of my fingers, he inquired if
it was gold; he was told it was the gift of one with whom
I should be happy to be at that time; he seemed to think
seriously, and at night told my interpreter, "That perhaps
his father" (as they all called me) "felt much grieved for
the want of a woman; if so, he could furnish him with one."
He was answered that with us each man had but one wife,
and that I considered it strictly my duty to remain faithful
to her. This he thought strange, he himself having three,
and replied that "He knew some Americans at his nation
who had half a dozen wives during the winter." The interpreter
observed that they were men without character; but
that all our great men had each but one wife. The chief
acquiesced, but said he liked better to have as many as he
pleased. This conversation passing without any appeal to
me, as the interpreter knew my mind on those occasions
and answered immediately, it did not appear as an immediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
refusal of the woman. Continued snowing very hard
all day. Slept very warm.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 19th.</i> This morning purchased two baskets of
sugar, for the amount of which I gave orders on Mr. Dickson.
After feasting upon a swan, took our leave for [the
Swan river] camp; still snowing. Finding my two companions
[the interpreter and Private Roy] unable to keep
up, I pushed on and arrived at the [Mississippi] river.
When I arrived at the place where I had hung up my first
goose [Mar. 17th], I found that the ravens and eagles had
not left a feather; and feasting upon the deer was a band
sufficient to have carried it away, which had picked its bones
nearly clean; what remained I gave my dogs. Stopped at
the place where I expected to find the last goose, but could
see nothing of it; at length I found it hid under the grass
and snow, where some animal had concealed it, after eating
off its head and neck. I carried it to the fort, where
I arrived about an hour before sundown. Dispatched
immediately two men with rackets to meet the interpreter
and Le Roy [Private A. Roy]. They arrived about two
hours after dark. Some men also arrived at [from?] the
hunting-camp with three deer. The snow ceased falling
about one hour after dark; it was nearly two feet deep on
a level, the deepest that had fallen so low down this winter.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 20th.</i> Dispatched nine men to my hunting-camp,
whence received two deer. Cloudy almost all day; but the
water rose fast over the ice.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 21st.</i> Received a visit from the Fols Avoin chief
called the Shawonoe, and six young men. I informed him
without reserve of the news I had heard of him at [Lower]
Red Cedar Lake, and the letter I wrote to Mr. Dickson.
He denied it in toto, and on the contrary said that he presented
his flag and two medals to the Chipeways, as an
inducement for them to descend in the spring; and gave
them all the encouragement in his power. His party was
much astonished at the language I held with him. But
from his firm protestations we finally parted friends. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
informed me that a camp of Sauteurs were on the river,
waiting for the chiefs to come down; from which it appeared
they were still expected. At night, after the others
had gone, Thomas arrived and stayed all night. We agreed
upon a hunting-party; also promised to pay old Shawonoe
a visit. He informed me that he set out the other day to
follow me, but finding the storm so very bad returned to
his wigwam. The thermometer lower than it has been at
any time since I commenced my voyage.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 22d.</i> Ten of my men arrived from the hunting-camp
with 4Â½ deer. Thomas departed; I sent a man with
him to his camps, from which he sent me two beavers.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 23d.</i> Agreeably to promise, after breakfast
I departed with Miller and my interpreter to pay a visit to
the old chief Shawonoe. We arrived at his camp in about
two hours. On our way we met the Fols Avoin called
Chein Blanche [Chien Blanc], who had visited my post
[Dec. 7th] previously to my starting up the river, and at
whose house we stopped when passing. We were received
by old Shawonoe at his lodge with the usual Indian hospitality,
but very different from the polite reception given
us by Thomas.</p>

<p>Charlevoix and others have all borne testimony to the
beauty of this nation. From my own observation, I had
sufficient reason to confirm their information as respected
the males; for they were all straight and well-made, about
the middle size; their complexions generally fair for
savages, their teeth good, their eyes large and rather languishing;
they have a mild but independent expression of
countenance, that charms at first sight; in short, they would
be considered anywhere as handsome men. But their
account of the women I never before believed to be correct.
In this lodge there were five very handsome women when
we arrived; and about sundown a married pair arrived,
whom my interpreter observed were the handsomest couple
he knew; and in truth they were, the man being about
5 feet 11 inches, and possessing in an eminent manner all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
the beauties of countenance which distinguish his nation.
His companion was 22 years old, having dark brown eyes,
jet hair, an elegantly proportioned neck, and her figure by
no means inclined to corpulency, as they generally are after
marriage. He appeared to attach himself particularly to
me, and informed that his wife was the daughter of an
American who, passing through the nation about 23 years
before, remained a week or two possessed of her mother,
and that she was the fruit of this amour; but his name
they were unacquainted with. I had brought six biscuits
with me, which I presented her on the score of her being
my countrywoman; this raised a loud laugh, and she was
called "the Bostonian"<a name="FNanchor_III-27" id="FNanchor_III-27" href="#Footnote_III-27" class="fnanchor">[III-27]</a> during the rest of my stay.</p>

<p>I found them generally extremely hard to deal with.
My provision being only a little venison, I wished to procure
some bear's oil, for a few gallons of which I was
obliged to pay $1 per gallon, and then they wanted to mix
tallow with the oil. They also demanded $10 for a bearskin,
the most beautiful I ever saw, which I wanted to mount a
saddle. Indeed I was informed that traders in this country
sometimes give as much as $16 [apiece] for bearskins, for
they are eminently superior to anything of the kind on the
lower Mississippi, and sell in Europe for double the price.
In the evening we were entertained with the calumet and
dog dance; also the dance of the &mdash;&mdash;. Some of the
men struck the post and told some of their war exploits;
but as they spoke in Menomene, my interpreter could not
explain it. After the dance, we had the feast of the dead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
as it is called, at which each two or three were served with
a pan or vessel full of meat, and when all were ready there
was a prayer, after which the eating commenced. Then it
was expected we should eat up our portion entirely, being
careful not to drop a bone, but to gather all up and put
them in the dish. We were then treated with soup. After
the eating was finished the chief again gave an exhortation,
which finished the ceremony. I am told they then gather
up all the fragments, and throw them in the water, lest the
dogs should get them. Burning them is considered as
sacrilegious. In this lodge were collected at one time 41
persons, great and small, 17 of whom were capable of bearing
arms, besides dogs without number.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 24th.</i> Rose early and with my dog-sled arrived at
the fort before ten o'clock. In the afternoon Mr. Grant
arrived with De Breche [BrÃ¨che-dent] and some of his young
men. Saluted him with 14 rounds. Found my two young
warriors [Buck and Beau] of Leech Lake were brave enough
to return to their homes. Mr. Grant and myself sat up late
talking.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 25th.</i> Sent an Indian to Thomas' lodge, and a letter
to Mr. Dickson. It snowed and stormed all day. Gave
the chief the news.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 26th.</i> Thomas, the Fols Avoin chief, arrived with
seven of his men, and old Shawonoe and six of his party. I
had them all to feed as well as my own men. At night I
gave them leave to dance in the garrison, which they did
until ten o'clock; but once or twice told me that if I was
tired of them the dance should cease. Old Shawonoe and
White Dog [Chien Blanc] of the Fols Avoins told their exploits,
which we could not understand; but De Breche arose
and said, "I once killed a Sioux and cut off his head with
such a spear as I now present to this Winebago"&mdash;at the
same time presenting one to a Winebago present, with whom
the Chipeways were at war; this was considered by the former
as a great honor. My hunters went out but killed
nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p><i>Mar. 27th.</i> In the morning the Chipeway chief made a
speech and presented his peace pipe to me to bear to the
Sioux, on which were seven strings of wampum, as authority
from seven bands of the Chipeways either to conclude
peace or to make war. As he had chosen the former, he
sent his pipe to the Sioux and requested me to inform them
that he and his people would encamp at the mouth of the
Riviere De Corbeau the ensuing summer, where he would
see the United States flag flying. As a proof of his pacific
disposition, the Fols Avoin chief then spoke and said: "His
nation was rendered small by its enemies; only a remnant
was left, but they could boast of not being slaves; for that
always in preference to their women and children being
taken, they themselves killed them. But that their father
(as they called me) had traveled far, and had taken much
pains to prevent the Sioux and Chipeways from killing one
another; that he thought none could be so ungenerous as to
neglect listening to the words of their father; that he would
report to the Sioux the pacific disposition of the Sauteurs,
and hoped the peace would be firm and lasting." I then in
a few words informed De Breche "that I would report to
the Sioux all he had said, and that I should ever feel
pleased and grateful that the two nations had laid aside the
tomahawk at my request. That I thanked the Fols Avoin
chief for his good wishes and parole which he had given the
Sauteurs." After all this, each chief was furnished with a
kettle of liquor, to drink each other's health; and De
Breche's flag which I had presented him was displayed in
the fort. The Fols Avoins then departed, at which I was
by no means displeased; for they had already consumed
all the dry meat I had laid aside for my voyage, and I
was apprehensive that my hunters would not be able to
lay up another supply.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 28th.</i> Late in the afternoon Mr. Grant and the
Sauteurs took their departure, calculating that the Sioux had
left the country. Took with me one of my soldiers and
accompanied them to the Fols Avoins lodge, called the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Shawonese, where we ten stayed all night. The Fols Avoins
and Sauteurs had a dance, at which I left them and went
to sleep. Feasted on elk, sugar, and syrup. Previously to
the Indians' departing from my post, I demanded the
chief's medal and flags; the former he delivered, but with
a bad grace; the latter he said were in the lands when I left
Lake De Sable (as instructed by the traders I suppose), and
that he could not obtain them. It thundered and lightened.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 29th.</i> We all marched in the morning, Mr. Grant
and party for Sandy Lake, and I for my hunting-camp. I
gave him my spaniel dog. He joined me again after we
had separated about five miles. Arrived at my hunting-camp
about eight o'clock in the morning, and was informed
that my hunters had gone to bring in a deer; they arrived
with it, and about eleven o'clock we all went out hunting.
Saw but few deer, out of which I had the good fortune to
kill two. On our arrival at camp found one of my men at
the garrison with a letter from Mr. Dickson. The soldier
informed me that one Sioux had arrived with Mr. Dickson's
men. Although much fatigued, as soon as I had eaten something
I took one of my men and departed for the garrison
one hour before sundown. The distance was 21 miles, and
the ice very dangerous, being rotten, with water over it
nearly a foot deep; we had sticks in our hands, and in many
places ran them through the ice. It thundered and lightened,
with rain. The Sioux, not finding the Sauteurs, had
returned immediately.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Mar. 30th.</i> Wrote to Mr. Dickson, and dispatched
his man. Considerably stiff from my yesterday's
march. Calked our boats, as the ice had every appearance
of breaking up in a few days. Thus while on the wing of
eager expectation, every day seemed an age. Received 2Â½
deer from our hunting-camp.</p>

<p><i>Mar. 31st.</i> Finished calking my boats; the difficulty
then was with me, what I should get to pitch the seams.
We were all this day and next as anxiously watching the
ice as a lover would the arrival of the priest who was to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
unite him to his beloved. Sometimes it moved a little, but
soon closed. An Indian and his woman crossed it when the
poles which they held in their hands were forced through in
many places. The provision to which I was obliged to restrict
myself and men, viz., two pounds of fresh venison per
day, was scarcely sufficient to keep us alive. Though I had
not an extraordinary appetite, yet I was continually hungry.</p>

<p>[<i>Apr. 1st.</i> No entry.]</p>

<p><i>Apr. 2d.</i> Went out and killed one deer and two partridges.
The ice began to move opposite the fort at the foot
of the rapids, but dammed up below. Received half a dozen
bears from my hunting-camp. Launched our canoe and
brought her down.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 3d.</i> Sent one man down to see the river, another to
the camp, and took two men myself over the hills on the
other side of the Mississippi to hunt. In the course of the
day I killed a swan and a goose, and we certainly would
have killed one or two elk had it not been for the sleigh-dogs;
for we lay concealed on the banks of Clear river
when four came and threw themselves into it opposite, and
were swimming directly to us when our dogs bounced into
the water, and they turned. We then fired on them, but
they carried off all the lead we gave them, and we could not
cross the river unless we rafted (it being bank-full), which
would have detained us too long a time. In the evening it
became very cold, and we passed rather an uncomfortable
night.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 4th.</i> Took our course home. I killed one large
buck and wounded another. We made a fire and ate breakfast.
Arrived at the fort at two o'clock. Was informed
that the river was still shut below, at the cluster of [Beltrami's
Archipelago, Pike's Beaver, and now the Thousand]
islands. Received some bear-meat and one deer from the
camp.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 5th.</i> In the morning dispatched two men down
the river in order to see if it was open. My hunters arrived
from the camps. Tallowed my boats with our candles and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
launched them; they made considerable water. The young
[son of] Shawonoe arrived in my canoe from above, with
about 1,000 lbs. of fur, which he deposited in the fort. The
men returned and informed me that the river was still shut
about 10 miles below.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 6th.</i> Sailed my peroque with Sergeant
Bradley [promoted, <i>vice</i> Kennerman reduced] and two men,
to descend the river and see if it was yet open below. They
returned in the afternoon and reported all clear. I had previously
determined to load and embark the next day, and
hoped to find it free by the time I arrived. The Fols Avoin
called the Shawonoe arrived and encamped near the stockade.
He informed me that his nation had determined to
send his son down in his place, as he declined the voyage to
St. Louis. All hearts and hands were employed in preparing
for our departure. In the evening the men cleared out their
room, danced to the violin, and sang songs until eleven o'clock,
so rejoiced was every heart at leaving this savage wilderness.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 7th.</i> Loaded our boats and departed at 40 minutes
past ten o'clock. At one o'clock arrived at Clear river,
where we found my canoe and men. Although I had partly
promised the Fols Avoin chief to remain one night, yet time
was too precious, and we put off; passed the Grand [Sauk]
Rapids, and arrived at Mr. Dickson's<a name="FNanchor_III-28" id="FNanchor_III-28" href="#Footnote_III-28" class="fnanchor">[III-28]</a> just before sun-down.
We were saluted with three rounds. At night he treated all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
my men with a supper and a dram. Mr. Dickson, Mr.
Paulier, and myself sat up until four o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 8th.</i> Were obliged to remain this day on account of
some information to be obtained here. I spent the day in
making a rough chart of St. Peters, notes on the Sioux, etc.,
and settling the affairs of the Indian department with Mr.
Dickson, for whose communications and those of Mr. Paulier
I am infinitely indebted. Made every necessary preparation
for an early embarkation.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 9th.</i> Rose early in the morning and commenced my
arrangements. Having observed two Indians drunk during
the night, and finding upon inquiry that the liquor had been
furnished by a Mr. Greignor or Jennesse [La Jeunesse], I
sent my interpreter to them to request they would not sell
any strong drink to the Indians; upon which Mr. Jennesse demanded
the restrictions in writing, which were given to him.<a name="FNanchor_III-29" id="FNanchor_III-29" href="#Footnote_III-29" class="fnanchor">[III-29]</a>
On demanding his license it amounted to no more than
merely a certificate that he had paid the tax required by a
law of the Indiana territory on all retailers of merchandise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and was by no means an Indian license; however, I did not
think proper to go into a more close investigation. Last
night was so cold that the water was covered with floating
cakes of ice, of a strong consistence. After receiving every
mark of attention from Messrs. Dickson and Paulier, I took
my departure at eight o'clock. At 4 p. m. arrived at the
house of Mr. Paulier, 25 leagues, to whose brother I had a
letter. Was received with politeness by him and a Mr.
Veau [Vean of 1807 text, p. 56] who had wintered alongside
of him, on the very island at which we had encamped
on the night of the [4th?] of October in ascending.</p>

<p>After having left this place some time, we discovered a
bark canoe ahead; we gained on it for some time, when it
turned a point about 300 yards before, and on our turning it
also, it had entirely disappeared. This excited my curiosity;
I stood up in the barge, and at last discovered it turned up
in the grass of the prairie; but after we had passed a good
gunshot, three savages made their appearance from under it,
launched it in the river, and followed, not knowing of my
other boats, which had just turned the point immediately
upon them. They then came on; and on my stopping for
the night at a vacant trading-house, they also stopped, and
addressed me, "<i>Saggo, Commandant</i>," or "Your servant,
Captain." I directed my interpreter to inquire their motives
for concealing themselves. They replied that their canoe
leaked, and that they had turned her up to discharge the
water. This I did not believe; and as their conduct was
equivocal I received them rather sternly; I gave them, however,
a small dram and piece of bread. They then re-embarked
and continued down the river.</p>

<p>Their conduct brought to mind the visit of Fils de Pinchow
to Mr. Dickson, during the winter; one principal
cause of which was that he wished to inform me that the
seven men, whom I mentioned to have met [Sept. 28th]
when crossing the portage of St. Anthony, had since declared
that they would kill him for agreeing to the peace
between the Sioux and the Sauteurs; me for being instrumental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
in preventing them from taking their revenge for
relations killed by Sauteurs in August, 1805; and Thomas,
the Fols Avoin chief, for the support he seemed disposed to
give me. This information had not made the impression it
ought to have made, coming from so respectable a source
as the first chief of the village; but the conduct of those
fellows put me to the consideration of it. And I appeal to
God and my country, if self-preservation would not have
justified me in cutting those scoundrels to pieces wherever
I found them? This my men would have done, if ordered,
amid a thousand of them, and I should have been supported
by the chiefs of the St. Peters, at the mouth of which were
300 warriors, attending my arrival; also [I should have
been justified in cutting to pieces], the rascal who fired on
my sentinel last winter [see Mar. 3d, <a href="#Page_178">p. 178</a>]. I dreaded
the consequences of the meeting, not for the present, but
for fear the impetuosity of my conduct might not be
approved of by my government, which did not so intimately
know the nature of those savages.</p>

<p>This day, for the first time, we saw the commencement of
vegetation; yet the snow was a foot deep in some places.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 10th.</i> Sailed at half past five o'clock; about seven
passed Rum river, and at eight were saluted by six or seven
lodges of Fols Avoins, among whom was a Mr. [Blank],
a clerk of Mr. Dickson's. Those people had wintered on
Rum river, and were waiting for their chiefs and traders to
descend in order to accompany them to the Prairie Des
Chiens. Arrived at the Falls of St. Anthony at ten o'clock.
Carried over all our lading and the canoe to the lower end
of the portage, and hauled our boats up on the bank. I
pitched my tents at the lower end of the encampment,
where all the men encamped except the guard, whose
quarters were above.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Falls was much more tremendous
than when we ascended; the increase of water occasioned
the spray to rise much higher, and the mist appeared like
clouds. How different my sensations now, from what they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
were when at this place before! At that time, not having
accomplished more than half my route, winter fast approaching,
war existing between the most savage nations in
the course of my route, my provisions greatly diminished
and but a poor prospect of an additional supply, many of
my men sick and the others not a little disheartened, our
success in this arduous undertaking very doubtful, just upon
the borders of the haunts of civilized men, about to launch
into an unknown wilderness&mdash;for ours was the first canoe
that had ever crossed this portage&mdash;were reasons sufficient
to dispossess my breast of contentment and ease. But now
we have accomplished every wish, peace reigns throughout
the vast extent, we have returned thus far on our voyage
without the loss of a single man, and hope soon to be
blessed with the society of our relations and friends.</p>

<p>The river this morning was covered with ice, which continued
floating all day; the shores were still barricaded
with it.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 11th.</i> Although it snowed very hard, we brought
over both boats and descended the river to the [Pike's] island
at the entrance of the St. Peters. I sent to the chiefs and
informed them I had something to communicate to them.
Fils de Pinchow immediately waited on me, and informed
me that he would provide a place for the purpose. About
sundown I was sent for and introduced into the council-house,
where I found a great many chiefs of the Sussitongs,
Gens des Feuilles, and Gens du Lac. The Yanctongs had
not yet come down. They were all waiting for my arrival.
There were about 100 lodges, or 600 people; we were saluted
on our crossing the river with ball, as usual. The council-house
was two large lodges, capable of containing 300 men.
In the upper were 40 chiefs, and as many pipes set against
the poles, alongside of which I had the Sauteur's pipes
arranged. I then informed them in short detail of my transactions
with the Sauteurs; but my interpreters were not
capable of making themselves understood. I was therefore
obliged to omit mentioning every particular relative to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
rascal who fired on my sentinel, and to the scoundrel who
broke the Fols Avoins' canoes and threatened my life. The
interpreters, however, informed them that I wanted some of
their principal chiefs to go to St. Louis; and that those who
thought proper might descend to the prairie [Prairie du
Chien], where we would give them more explicit information.
They all smoked out of the Sauteurs' pipes, excepting
three, who were painted black and who were some of those
who lost their relations last winter. I invited Fils de Pinchow
and the son of Killeur Rouge to come over and sup
with me; when Mr. Dickson and myself endeavored to
explain what I intended to have said to them, could I have
made myself understood; that at the Prairie we would have
all things explained; that I was desirous of making a better
report of them than Capt. [Meriwether] Lewis could do from
their treatment of him. The former of those savages was
the person who remained around my post all last winter,
and treated my men so well; they endeavored to excuse
their people, etc.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 12th.</i> Embarked early. Although my interpreter
had been frequently up the river, he could not tell me where
the cave spoken of by Carver could be found; we carefully
sought for it, but in vain.<a name="FNanchor_III-30" id="FNanchor_III-30" href="#Footnote_III-30" class="fnanchor">[III-30]</a> At the Indian village a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
miles above [read below: see <a href="#Footnote_I-72">note<sup>72</sup></a>, p. 74] St. Peters we
were about to pass a few lodges, but on receiving a very
particular invitation to come on shore, we landed and were
received in a lodge kindly; they presented us sugar, etc. I
gave the proprietor a dram, and was about to depart, when
he demanded a kettle of liquor; on being refused, and after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
I had left the shore, he told me that he did not like the
arrangements and that he would go to war this summer. I
directed the interpreter to tell him that if I returned to the
St. Peters with the troops I would settle that affair with
him. On our arrival at the St. Croix, I found Petit Corbeau
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
[Little Raven: see <a href="#Footnote_II-2">note<sup>2</sup></a>, p. 85] with his people, and
Messrs. Frazer and Wood. We had a conference, when
Petit Corbeau made many apologies for the misconduct of
his people; he represented to us the different manners in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
which his young warriors had been inducing him to go to
war; that he had been much blamed for dismissing his party
last fall, but that he was determined to adhere as far as lay
in his power to our instructions; that he thought it most
prudent to remain here and restrain the warriors. He then
presented me with a beaver robe and pipe, and his message
to the general, that he was determined to preserve peace,
and make the road clear; also, a remembrance of his promised
medal. I made him a reply calculated to confirm him
in his good intentions, and assured him that he should not
be the less remembered by his father, although not present.</p>

<p>I was informed that notwithstanding the instruction of
his license and my particular request, Murdoch Cameron
[see <a href="#Footnote_I-64">note<sup>64</sup></a>, p. 66] had taken liquor and sold it to the Indians
on the river St. Peters, and that his partner below had been
equally imprudent. I pledged myself to prosecute them
according to law; for they have been the occasion of great
confusion and of much injury to the other traders.</p>

<p>This day we met a canoe of Mr. Dickson's loaded with
provision, under the charge of Mr. Anderson, brother of
Mr. [George] Anderson at Leech Lake. He politely offered
me any provision he had on board, for which Mr. Dickson
had given me an order; but not now being in want I did
not accept of any. This day, for the first time, I observed
the trees beginning to bud, and indeed the climate seemed
to have changed very materially since we passed the Falls
of St. Anthony.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 13th.</i> We embarked after breakfast.
Messrs. Frazer and Wood accompanied me. Wind strong
ahead. They outrowed us&mdash;the first boat or canoe we met
with on the voyage able to do it; but then they were
double-manned and light. Arrived at the band of Aile
Rouge [Red Wing: see <a href="#Footnote_I-67">note<sup>67</sup></a>, p. 69] at two o'clock, where
we were saluted as usual.</p>

<p>We had a council, when he spoke with more detestation
of the conduct of the rascals at the mouth of the St. Peters
than any man I had yet heard. He assured me, speaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
of the fellow who had fired on my sentinel and threatened
to kill me, that if I thought it requisite, he should be killed;
but as there were many chiefs above with whom he wished
to speak, he hoped I would remain one day, when all the
Sioux would be down, and I might have the command of
a thousand men of them; that I would probably think it
no honor, but that the British used to flatter them they
were proud of having them for soldiers. I replied in
general terms, and assured him it was not for the conduct
of two or three rascals that I meant to pass over all the
good treatment I had received from the Sioux nation; but
that in general council I would explain myself. That as to
the scoundrel who fired at my sentinel, had I been at home
the Sioux nation would never have been troubled with
him, for I would have killed him on the spot; but that my
young men did not do it, apprehensive that I would be displeased.
I then gave him the news of the Sauteurs, etc.;
that as to remaining one day, it would be of no service;
that I was much pressed to arrive below, as my general
expected me, my duty called me, and the state of my provision
demanded the utmost expedition; that I would be
happy to oblige him, but my men must eat. He replied
that, Lake Pepin being yet shut with ice, if I went on and
encamped on the ice it would not get me provision; that
he would send out all his young men the next day; and
that if the other bands did not arrive he would depart the
day after with me. In short, after much talk, I agreed to
remain one day, knowing that the lake was closed and that
we could proceed only nine miles if we went.</p>

<p>This appeared to give general satisfaction. I was invited
to different feasts, and entertained at one by a person
whose father had been enacted a chief by the Spaniards.
At this feast I saw a man called by the French Roman
Nose [Nez de Corbeau<a name="FNanchor_III-31" id="FNanchor_III-31" href="#Footnote_III-31" class="fnanchor">[III-31]</a>], and by the Indians Wind that
Walks, who was formerly the second chief of the Sioux;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
but being the cause of the death of one of the traders, seven
years since, he voluntarily relinquished that dignity, and
has frequently requested to be given up to the whites. But
he was now determined to go to St. Louis and deliver himself
up, where he said they might put him to death. His
long repentance and the great confidence of the nation in
him would perhaps protect him from a punishment which
the crime merited. But as the crime was committed long
before the United States assumed its authority, and as no
law of theirs could affect it, unless it were ex post facto and
had a retrospective effect, I conceived it would certainly be
dispunishable<a name="FNanchor_III-32" id="FNanchor_III-32" href="#Footnote_III-32" class="fnanchor">[III-32]</a> now. I did not think proper, however, to
so inform him. I here received a letter from Mr. Rollett,<a name="FNanchor_III-33" id="FNanchor_III-33" href="#Footnote_III-33" class="fnanchor">[III-33]</a>
partner of Mr. Cameron, with a present of some brandy,
coffee, and sugar. I hesitated about receiving those articles
from the partner of the man I intended to prosecute: their
amount being trifling, however, I accepted of them, offering
him pay. I assured him that the prosecution arose from
a sense of duty, and not from any personal prejudice. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
canoe did not come up, in consequence of the head wind.
Sent out two men in a canoe to set fishing-lines; the canoe
overset, and had it not been for the timely assistance of the
savages, who carried them into their lodges, undressed
them, and treated them with the greatest humanity and
kindness, they must inevitably have perished. At this
place I was informed that the rascal spoken of as having
threatened my life had actually cocked his gun to shoot
me from behind the hills, but was prevented by the
others.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 14th.</i> Was invited to a feast by Roman Nose. His
conversation was interesting, and shall be detailed hereafter.
The other Indians had not yet arrived. Messrs. Wood,
Frazer, and myself ascended a high hill called the Barn [or
La Grange; see <a href="#Footnote_I-68">note<sup>68</sup></a>, p. 70], from which we had a view of
Lake Pepin, of the valley through which the Mississippi by
numerous channels wound itself to the St. Croix, the Cannon
river, and the lofty hills on each side.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 15th.</i> Arose very early and embarked about sunrise,
much to the astonishment of the Indians, who were entirely
prepared for the council when they heard I had put off.
However, after some conversation with Mr. Frazer, they
acknowledged that it was agreeably to what I had said, that
I would sail early, and that they could not blame me. I
was very positive in my word, for I found it by far the best
way to treat the Indians. Aile Rouge had a beaver robe
and pipe prepared to present, but was obliged for the present
to retain it. Passed through Lake Pepin with my
barges; the canoe being obliged to lie by, did not come on.
Stopped at a prairie on the right bank, descending about
nine miles below Lake Pepin. Went out to view some hills
which had the appearance of the old fortifications spoken
of [by Carver: see note of the Grand Encampment, <a href="#Page_59">p.
59</a>]; but I will speak more fully of them hereafter. In
these hollows I discovered a flock of elk; took out 15 men,
but we were not able to kill any. Mr. Frazer came up and
passed on about two miles. We encamped together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Neither Mr. Wood's nor my canoe arrived. Snowed considerably.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 16th.</i> Mr. Frazer's canoes and my boats sailed about
one hour by the sun. We waited some time, expecting Mr.
Wood's barges and my canoe; but hearing a gun fired
just above our encampment, we were induced to make sail.
Passed Aile Prairie [Winona: <a href="#Footnote_I-57">note<sup>57</sup></a>, p. 54], also La Montagne
qui Trompe a [Trempe Ã ] L'eau, the prairie De Cross [La
Crosse], and encamped on the W. shore [at Brownsville], a
few hundred yards below where I had encamped on the
[11th] day of September, in ascending. Killed a goose flying.
Shot at some pigeons at our camp, and was answered
from behind an island with two guns; we returned them,
and were replied to by two more. This day the trees
appeared in bloom. Snow might still be seen on the sides
of the hills. Distance 75 miles.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 17th.</i> Put off pretty early and arrived at Wabasha's
band at eleven o'clock, where I [was] detained all day for
him [at Upper Iowa river]; but he alone of all the hunters
remained out all night. Left some powder and tobacco
for him. The Sioux presented me with a kettle of boiled
meat and a deer. I here received information that the
Puants had killed some white men below. Mr. Wood's
and my canoe arrived.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 18th.</i> Departed from our encampment very early.
Stopped to breakfast at the Painted Rock. Arrived at
Prairie Des Cheins at two o'clock, and were received by
crowds on the bank. Took up my quarters at Mr. Fisher's.
My men received a present of one barrel of pork from
Mr. Campbell, a bag of biscuit, 20 loaves of bread, and
some meat from Mr. Fisher. A Mr. Jearreau, from Cahokia,
is here, who embarks to-morrow for St. Louis. I wrote to
General Wilkinson by him.<a name="FNanchor_III-34" id="FNanchor_III-34" href="#Footnote_III-34" class="fnanchor">[III-34]</a> I was called on by a number
of chiefs, Reynards, Sioux of the Des Moyan [Des Moines
river], etc. The Winebagos were here intending, as I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
informed, to deliver some of the murderers to me. Received
a great deal of news from the States and Europe, both civil
and military.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 19th.</i> Dined at Mr. Campbell's in company with
Messrs. Wilmot, Blakely, Wood, Rollet, Fisher, Frazer, and
Jearreau. Six canoes arrived from the upper part of St.
Peters, with the Yanctong chiefs from the head of that river.
Their appearance was indeed savage, much more so than
any nation I have yet seen. Prepared my boat for sail.
Gave notice to the Puants that I had business to do with
them the next day. A band of the Gens Du Lac arrived.
Took into my pay as interpreter Mr. Y. [read J.] Reinville.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 20th.</i> Held a council with the Puant chiefs,
and demanded of them the murderers of their nation;<a name="FNanchor_III-35" id="FNanchor_III-35" href="#Footnote_III-35" class="fnanchor">[III-35]</a>
they required till to-morrow to consider it. I made a written
demand of the magistrates to take depositions concerning
the late murders.<a name="FNanchor_III-36" id="FNanchor_III-36" href="#Footnote_III-36" class="fnanchor">[III-36]</a> Had a private conversation with
Wabasha.</p>

<p>This afternoon they had a great game of the cross on the
prairie, between the Sioux on the one side, and the Puants
and Reynards on the other. The ball is made of some hard
substance and covered with leather; the cross-sticks are
round and net-work, with handles of three feet long. The
parties being ready, and bets agreed upon, sometimes to
the amount of some thousand dollars, the goals are set up
on the prairie at the distance of half a mile. The ball is
thrown up in the middle, and each party strives to drive it
to the opposite goal; when either party gains the first rubber,
which is driving it quick round the post, the ball is
again taken to the center, the ground changed, and the contest
renewed; and this is continued until one side gains four
times, which decides the bet. It is an interesting sight to
see two or three hundred naked savages contending on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
plain who shall bear off the palm of victory; as he who
drives the ball round the goal is much shouted at by his
companions. It sometimes happens that one catches the
ball in his racket, and depending on his speed endeavors to
carry it to the goal; when he finds himself too closely pursued
he hurls it with great force and dexterity to an amazing
distance, where there are always flankers of both parties
ready to receive it; it seldom touches the ground, but is
sometimes kept in the air for hours before either party can
gain the victory. In the game which I witnessed the Sioux
were victorious&mdash;more, I believe, from the superiority of
their skill in throwing the ball than by their swiftness,
for I thought the Puants and Reynards the swiftest
runners.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 21st.</i> Was sent for by La Feuille, and had a long
and interesting conversation with him, in which he spoke
of the general jealousy of his nation toward their chiefs;
and said that although he knew it might occasion some of
the Sioux displeasure, he did not hesitate to declare that
he looked on Nez Corbeau [otherwise Raven Nose and
Roman Nose] as the man of most sense in their nation, and
he believed it would be generally acceptable if he was
reinstated in his rank. Upon my return I was sent for by
Red Thunder,<a name="FNanchor_III-37" id="FNanchor_III-37" href="#Footnote_III-37" class="fnanchor">[III-37]</a> chief of the Yanctongs, the most savage
band of the Sioux. He was prepared with the most elegant
pipes and robes I ever saw, and shortly declared, "That
white blood had never been shed in the village of the
Yanctongs, even when rum was permitted; that Mr. Murdoch
Cameron arrived at his village last autumn; that he
invited him to eat, gave him corn as a bird; that Cameron
informed him of the prohibition of rum, and was the only
person who afterward sold it in the village." After this I
had a council with the Puants. Spent the evening with Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Wilmot, one of the best informed and most gentlemanly
men in the place.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 22d.</i> Held a council with the Sioux and Puants,
the latter of whom delivered up their [British] medals and
flags. Prepared to depart to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 23d.</i> After closing my accounts, etc., at half past
twelve o'clock we left the Prairie; at the lower end of it
were saluted by 17 lodges of the Puants. Met a barge, by
which I received a letter from my lady. Further on met
one batteau and one canoe of traders. Passed one trader's
camp. Arrived at Mr. Dubuque's at [mouth of Catfish
Creek, at] ten o'clock at night; found some traders encamped
at the entrance with 40 or 50 Indians; obtained some information
from Mr. D., and requested him to write me on certain
points. After we had boiled our victuals, I divided my
men into four watches and put off, wind ahead. Observed
for the first time the half-formed leaves on the trees.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 24th.</i> In the morning we used our oars until ten
o'clock, and then floated while breakfasting. At this time
two barges, one bark, and two wooden canoes passed us
under full sail; by one of which I sent back a letter to Mr.
Dubuque that I had forgotten to deliver. Stopped at dark
to cook supper; after which, rowed under the windward
shore, expecting we could make headway with four oars;
but were blown on the lee shore in a few moments, when
all hands were summoned, and we again with difficulty
made to windward, came-to, placed one sentry on my bow,
and all hands beside went to sleep. It rained, and before
morning the water overflowed my bed in the bottom of the
boat, having no cover or any extra accommodations, as it
might have retarded my voyage. The wind very hard
ahead.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 25th.</i> Obliged to unship our mast to prevent its
rolling overboard with the swell. Passed the first Reynard
village [near head of Rock River rapids on the Iowan side]
at twelve o'clock; counted 18 lodges. Stopped at the
prairie in descending on the left, about the middle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
rapids, where there is a beautiful cove or harbor [Watertown,
Rock Island Co., Ill.]. There were three lodges of
Indians here, but none of them came near us. Shortly
after we had left this, observed a barge under sail, with the
United States flag, which upon our being seen put to shore
on the Big [now Rock] Island, about three miles above
Stony [Rock] river, where I also landed. It proved to be
Capt. Many<a name="FNanchor_III-38" id="FNanchor_III-38" href="#Footnote_III-38" class="fnanchor">[III-38]</a> of the Artillerists, who was in search of some
Osage prisoners among the Sacs and Reynards. He informed
me that at the [large Sac] village of Stony Point
[near the mouth of Rock river] the Indians evinced a
strong disposition to commit hostilities; that he was met
at the mouth of the river by an old Indian, who said that
all the inhabitants of the village were in a state of intoxication,
and advised him to go up alone. This advice, however,
he had rejected. That when they arrived there they
were saluted by the appellation of the bloody Americans
who had killed such a person's father, such a person's
mother, brother, etc. The women carried off the guns and
other arms, and concealed them. That he then crossed the
river opposite the village, and was followed by a number
of Indians with pistols under their blankets. That they
would listen to no conference whatever relating to the
delivery of the prisoners, but demanded insolently why he
wore a plume in his hat, declared that they looked on it as
a mark of war, and immediately decorated themselves with
their raven's feathers, worn only in cases of hostility. We
regretted that our orders would not permit of our punishing
the scoundrels, as by a <i>coup de main</i> we might easily have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
carried the village. Gave Capt. Many a note of introduction
to Messrs. Campbell, Fisher, Wilmot, and Dubuque,
and every information in my power. We sat up late
conversing.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 26th.</i> Capt. Many and myself took breakfast and
embarked; wind directly ahead, and a most tremendous
swell to combat, which has existed ever since we left the
prairie. Capt. Many under full sail. Descended by all the
sinuosity of the shore, to avoid the strength of the wind
and force of the waves. Indeed I was confident I could
sail much faster up than we could possibly make down.
Encamped on Grant's prairie, where we had encamped Aug.
25th when ascending. There was one Indian and family
present, to whom I gave some corn.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, Apr. 27th.</i> It cleared off during the night. We
embarked early and came from eight or ten leagues above
the river Iowa to the [U.Â S. agricultural] establishment at
the lower Sac village [at Nauvoo, Ill., see <a href="#Page_14">Aug. 20th,
1805</a>] by sundown, a distance of nearly 48 leagues. Here
I met with Messrs. Maxwell and Blondeau; took the
deposition of the former on the subject of the Indians'
intoxication at this place, for they were all drunk. They
had stolen a horse from the establishment, and offered to
bring him back for liquor, but laughed at them when
offered a blanket and powder. Passed two canoes and two
barges. At the establishment received two letters from
Mrs. Pike. Took with us Corporal Eddy and the other
soldier whom Capt. Many had left. Rowed with four oars
all night. A citizen took passage with me.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 28th.</i> In the morning passed a wintering-ground
where, from appearance, there must have been at least
seven or eight different establishments. At twelve o'clock
arrived at the French house [Hurricane Settlement] mentioned
in our voyage up, Aug. 16th [see <a href="#Footnote_I-13">note<sup>13</sup></a>, that date].
Here we landed our citizen; his name was [Blank], and he
belonged to the settlement on Copper river. He informed
me there were about 25 families in the settlement.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Stopped at some islands [<a href="#Footnote_I-12">note<sup>12</sup></a>, Aug. 15th] about ten
miles above Salt river, where there were pigeon-roosts, and
in about 15 minutes my men had knocked on the head and
brought on board 298. I had frequently heard of the
fecundity of this bird [<i>Ectopistes migratorius</i><a name="FNanchor_III-39" id="FNanchor_III-39" href="#Footnote_III-39" class="fnanchor">[III-39]</a>], and never
gave credit to what I then thought inclined to the marvelous;
but really the most fervid imagination cannot conceive
their numbers. Their noise in the woods was like the
continued roaring of the wind, and the ground may be said
to have been absolutely covered with their excrement. The
young ones which we killed were nearly as large as the old;
they could fly about ten steps, and were one mass of fat; their
craws were filled with acorns and the wild pea. They were
still reposing on their nests, which were merely small bunches
of sticks joined, with which all the small trees were covered.</p>

<p>Met four canoes of the Sacs, with wicker baskets filled
with young pigeons. They made motions to exchange
them for liquor, to which I returned the back of my hand.
Indeed those scoundrels had become so insolent, through
the instigation of the traders, that nothing but the lenity of
our government and humanity for the poor devils could
have restrained me on my descent from carrying some of
their towns by surprise, which I was determined to have
done had the information of their firing on Capt. Many
proved to have been correct.</p>

<p>Put into the mouth of Salt river to cook supper, after
which, although raining, we put off and set our watches;
but so violent a gale and thunderstorm came on about
twelve o'clock that we put ashore. Discovered that one
of my sleigh-dogs was missing.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p><i>Apr. 29th.</i> In the morning still raining, and wind up the
river; hoisted sail and returned to the mouth of the river,
but neither here nor on the shore could we find my dog.
This was no little mortification, as it broke the match,
whose important services I had already experienced, after
having brought them so near home. We continued on until
twelve o'clock, when it ceased raining for a little time, and
we put ashore for breakfast. Rowed till sundown, when I
set the watch. Night fine and mild.</p>

<p><i>Apr. 30th.</i> By daylight found ourselves at the Portage
de Sioux. I here landed Captain Many's two men, and
ordered them across by land to the cantonment [Belle Fontaine,
on the Missouri]. As I had never seen the village, I
walked up and through it; there are not more than 21 houses
at furthest, which are built of square logs. Met Lieut.
Hughes<a name="FNanchor_III-40" id="FNanchor_III-40" href="#Footnote_III-40" class="fnanchor">[III-40]</a> about four miles above St. Louis,<a name="FNanchor_III-41" id="FNanchor_III-41" href="#Footnote_III-41" class="fnanchor">[III-41]</a> with more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
than 20 Osage prisoners, conveying them to the cantonment
on the Missouri; he informed me my friends were all well.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Arrived about twelve o'clock at the town, after an absence
of eight months and 22 days.</p>

<h3><i>Art. 1. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (Orig. No. 1, pp. 1, 2.)</i></h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Head of the Rapids de Moyen</span>, Aug. 20th, 1805.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>I arrived here this day, after what I have considered as
rather an unfortunate voyage, having had a series of rainy
weather for the first six days, by which means all our biscuit
was more or less damaged, they being in very bad and
open barrels; and our having got twice so fast on forked
sawyers or old trees as to oblige me partly to unload, and
staving in a plank on another [sawyer], which nearly sunk
our boat before we got on shore and detained us one whole
day. These all occasioned unavoidable detentions of two
days, and the innumerable islands and sand-bars which,
without exaggeration, exceed those of the river below the
Ohio, have been the cause of much unexpected delay. But
I calculate on getting to Prairie de Chien in at least the
same time I was in coming [from St. Louis] here.</p>

<p>We were met yesterday on the Rapids by Mr. William
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Ewing, who is sent here by the government of the United
States to teach the savages agriculture; and who, I perceive
in Governor Harrison's instructions, is termed an agent of
the United States, under the instructions of P. Choteau,
with, he says, a salary of $500 per annum. I conceived you
did not know of this functionary, else you would have mentioned
him to me. He was accompanied by Monsieur Louis
Tisson Houire [Tesson HonorÃ©<a name="FNanchor_V-2" id="FNanchor_V-2" href="#Footnote_V-2" class="fnanchor">[V-2]</a>], who informed me he had
calculated on going with me as my interpreter; he said that
you had spoken to him on the occasion, and appeared much
disappointed when I told him I had no instructions to that
effect. He also said he had promised to discover mines,
etc., which no person knew but himself; but, as I conceive
him much of a hypocrite, and possessing great gasconism, I
am happy he was not chosen for my voyage. They brought
with them three peroques of Indians, who lightened my
barge and assisted me up the Rapids. They expressed
great regret at the news of two men having been killed on
the river below, which I believe to be a fact, as I have it
from various channels, and were very apprehensive they
would be censured by our government as the authors [of
these murders], though from every inquiry they conceive it
not to be the case, and seem to ascribe the murders to the
Kickapoos. They strongly requested I would hear what
they had to say on the subject; this, with an idea that this
place would be a central position for a trading establishment
for the Sacs, Reynards, Iowas of the de Moyen, Sioux from
the head of said [Des Moines] river, and Paunte [Puants]
of the de Roche [Rock river], has induced me to halt part
of the day to-morrow. I should say more relative to Messrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Ewing and Houire, only that they propose visiting you
with the Indians who descend, as I understand by your
request, in about 30 days, when your penetration will give
you <i>le tout ensemble</i> of their characters [<a href="#Footnote_I-18">note<sup>18</sup></a>, p. 15].</p>

<p>I have taken the liberty of inclosing a letter to Mrs. Pike
to your care. My compliments to Lieutenant Wilkinson,
and the tender of my highest respects for your lady, with
the best wishes for your health and prosperity.</p>

<p class="left45">I am, General,<br />
<span class="i2">Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="i4">[Signed] <span class="smcap">Z. M. Pike</span>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Wilkinson.</span></p>

<hr class="l15 p2" />

<h3><i>Art. 2. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (Orig. No. 2, pp. 2-4.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Prairie du Chien</span>, Sept. 5th, 1805.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>I arrived here day before yesterday, and found my interpreter
gone in the employ of Mr. Dickson. I then endeavored
to gain information relative to crossing the falls; and
amidst the ignorance of the Canadians, and all the contradiction
in the world, I have learned it is impossible to carry
my large barge round the shoot [chute]. I have therefore
hired two Schenectady barges, in which I shall embark day
after to-morrow, with some expectation and hope of seeing
the head of the Mississippi and the town of St. Louis yet
this winter.</p>

<p>I have chosen three places for military establishments.
The first is on a hill about 40 miles above the river de
Moyen rapids, on the W. side of the river, in about 41Â° 2Â´
N. latitude. The channel of the river runs on that shore;
the hill in front is about 60 feet perpendicular, nearly level
on the top; 400 yards in the rear is a small prairie fit for
gardening; over on the E. side of the river you have an
elegant view on an immense prairie, as far as the eye can
extend, now and then interrupted by clumps of trees; and,
to crown all, immediately under the hill is a limestone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
spring, sufficient for the consumption of a regiment. The
landing is good and bold, and at the point of the hill a road
could be made for a wagon in half a day. This place I conceive
to be the best to answer the general's instructions
relative to an intermediate post between Prairie de Chien
and St. Louis; but if its being on the W. bank is a material
objection, about 30 miles above the second Sac village at
the third yellow bank on the E. side is a commanding place,
on a prairie and most elegantly situated; but it is scarce
of timber, and no water but that of the Mississippi. When
then thinking of the post to be established at the Ouiscousing
[mouth of Wisconsin river], I did not look at the
general's instructions. I therefore pitched on a spot on the
top of the hill on the W. side of the Mississippi [at or near
McGregor, Clayton Co., Ia.], which is &mdash;&mdash; feet high, level on
the top, and completely commands both rivers, the Mississippi
being only one-half mile wide and the Ouiscousing
about 900 yards when full. There is plenty of timber in the
rear, and a spring at no great distance on the hill. If this
position is to have in view the annoyance of any European
power who might be induced to attack it with cannon, it
has infinitely the preference to a position called the Petit
Gris on the Ouiscousing, which I visited and marked the
next day. This latter position is three miles up the
Ouiscousing, on a prairie hill on the W. side, where we
should be obliged to get our timber from the other side of
the river, and our water out of it; there is likewise a
small channel which runs on the opposite side, navigable
in high water, which could not be commanded by
the guns of the fort, and a hill about three-quarters of
a mile in the rear, from which it could be cannonaded.
These two positions I have marked by blazing trees, etc.
Mr. Fisher of this place will direct any officer who may be
sent to occupy them. I found the confluence of the
Ouiscousing and Mississippi to be in lat. 43Â° 28Â´ 8Â´Â´ N.</p>

<p>The day of my arrival at the lead mines, I was taken with
a fever which, with Monsieur Dubuque's having no horses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
about his house, obliged me to content myself with proposing
to him the inclosed queries [<a href="#Page_226">Art. 3</a>]; the answers seem
to carry with them the semblance of equivocation.</p>

<p>Messrs. Dubuque and Dickson were about sending a
number of chiefs to St. Louis, but the former confessing he
was not authorized, I have stopped them without in the
least dissatisfying the Indians.</p>

<p>Dickson is at Michilimackinac. I cannot say I have
experienced much spirit of accommodation from his clerks,
when in their power to oblige me; but I beg leave to
recommend to your attention Mr. James Aird, who is now
in your country, as a gentleman to whose humanity and
politeness I am much indebted; also Mr. Fisher of this
place, the captain of militia and justice of the peace.</p>

<p>A band of Sioux between here and the Mississippi have
applied for two medals, in order that they may have their
chiefs distinguished as friends of the Americans: if the
general thinks proper to send them here to the care of Mr.
Fisher, with any other commands, they may possibly meet
me here, or at the falls of St. Anthony, on my return.</p>

<p>[Lacuna here, indicating suppression of certain Spanish
privacies.]</p>

<p>The above suggestion would only be acceptable under
the idea of our differences with Spain being compromised;
as should there be war, the field of action is the sphere for
young men, where they hope, or at least aspire, to gather
laurels or renown to smooth the decline of age, or a glorious
death. You see, my dear general, I write to you like a
person addressing a father; at the same time I hope you
will consider me, not only in a professional but a personal
view, one who holds you in the highest respect and esteem.
My compliments to Lieutenant Wilkinson, and my highest
respects to your lady.</p>

<h3><i>Art. 3. The Dubuque Interrogation.<a name="FNanchor_V-3" id="FNanchor_V-3" href="#Footnote_V-3" class="fnanchor">[V-3]</a> Queries proposed to
Mr. Dubuque, with his answers.</i></h3>

<p>1. What is the date of your grant of the mines from the
savages?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The copy of the grant is in Mr. [Antoine Pierre]
Soulard's [Surveyor-general's] office at St. Louis.</p>

<p>2. What is the date of the confirmation by the Spaniards?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The same as to query first.</p>

<p>3. What is the extent of your grant?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> The same as above.</p>

<p>4. What is the extent of the mines?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Twenty-eight or twenty-seven leagues long, and
from one to three broad.</p>

<p>5. Lead made per annum?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> From 20,000 to 40,000 pounds.</p>

<p>6. Quantity of lead per cwt. of mineral?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> Seventy-five per cent.</p>

<p>7. Quantity of lead in pigs?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> All we make, as we neither manufacture bar, sheet-lead,
nor shot.</p>

<p>8. If mixed with any other mineral?</p>

<p><i>Ans.</i> We have seen some copper, but having no person
sufficiently acquainted with chemistry to make the experiment
properly, cannot say as to the proportion it bears to
the lead.</p>

<h3><i><a name="Art4" id="Art4">Art. 4.</a> Speech, Pike to the Sioux<a name="FNanchor_V-4" id="FNanchor_V-4" href="#Footnote_V-4" class="fnanchor">[V-4]</a> (Part of Orig. No. 3, pp.
6-8), delivered at the entrance of the river St. Peter's,
Sept. 23d, 1803.</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I am happy to meet you here at this council
fire, which your father has sent me to kindle, and to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
you by the hands as our children, we having lately acquired
from the Spanish [read French] the extensive territory of
Louisiana. Our general has thought proper to send out a
number of his young warriors to visit all his red children, to
tell them his will, and to hear what request they may have
to make of their father. I am happy the choice has fallen
on me to come this road; as I find my brothers, the Sioux,
ready to listen to my words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: It is the wish of our government to establish
military posts on the Upper Mississippi, at such places as
may be thought expedient. I have therefore examined the
country, and have pitched on the mouth of the St. Croix,
this place [mouth of the Minnesota river], and the Falls of
St. Anthony. I therefore wish you to grant to the United
States nine miles square at St. Croix; and at this place,
from a league below the confluence of St. Peter's and the
Mississippi to a league above St. Anthony, extending three
leagues on each side of the river. As we are a people who
are accustomed to have all our acts written down, in order
to have them handed down to our children, I have drawn
up a form of an agreement which we will both sign in the
presence of the traders now present. After we know the
terms we will fill it up, and have it read and interpreted to
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Those posts are intended as a benefit to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
you. The old chiefs now present must see that their situation
improves by communication with the whites. It is the
intention of the United States to establish factories at those
posts, in which the Indians may procure all their things at
a cheaper and better rate then they do now, or than your
traders can afford to sell them to you, as they are single
men who come far in small boats. But your fathers are
many and strong; they will come with a strong arm, in
large boats. There will also be chiefs here, who can attend
to the wants of their brothers, without your sending or
going all the way to St. Louis; they will see the traders
that go up your rivers, and know that they are good men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Another object your father has at heart, is to
endeavor to make peace between you and the Chipeways.
You have now been a long time at war, and when will you
stop? If neither side will lay down the hatchet, your paths
will always be red with blood; but if you will consent to make
peace, and suffer your father to bury the hatchet between
you, I will endeavor to bring down some of the Chipeway
chiefs with me to St. Louis, where the good work can be
completed under the auspices of your mutual father. I am
much pleased to see that the young warriors have halted to
hear my words this day; and as I know it is hard for a warrior
to be struck and not strike again, I will send word to
the chiefs by the first Chipeway I meet, that, if they have
not yet felt your tomahawk, it is not because you have not
the legs or the hearts of men, but because you have listened
to the voice of your father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: If their chiefs do not listen to the voice of
their father, and continue to commit murders on you and
our traders, they will call down the vengeance of the Americans;
for they are not like a blind man walking into the
fire. They were once at war with us, and joined to all the
northern Indians; they were defeated at Roche De B&oelig;uf,
and were obliged to sue for peace; that peace we granted
them. They know we are not children, but, like all wise
people, are slow to shed blood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Your old men probably know that about 30
years ago we were subject to and governed by the king of
the English; but he not treating us like children, we would
no longer acknowledge him as father; and after ten years'
war, in which he lost 100,000 men, he acknowledged us a
free and independent nation. They know that not many
years since we received Detroit, Michilimackinac, and all the
posts on the lakes from the English; and now&mdash;but the
other day&mdash;Louisiana from the Spanish [French]; so that
we put one foot on the sea at the east and the other on the
sea at the west; and if once children, are now men. Yet, I
think the traders who come from Canada are bad birds
amongst the Chipeways, and instigate them to make war on
their red brothers the Sioux, in order to prevent our traders
from going high up the Mississippi. This I shall inquire
into, and if it be so, shall warn those persons of their ill
conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Mr. Choteau was sent by your father to the
Osage nation, with one of his young chiefs.<a name="FNanchor_V-5" id="FNanchor_V-5" href="#Footnote_V-5" class="fnanchor">[V-5]</a> He sailed some
days before me, and had not time to procure the medals
which I am told he promised to send up; but they will be
procured.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I wish you to have some of your head chiefs
ready to go down with me in the spring. From the head of
the St. Pierre also, such other chiefs as you may think proper,
to the number of four or five. When I pass here on my way
I will send you word at what time you will meet me at the
Prairie des Chiens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I expect that you will give orders to all your
young warriors to respect my flag, and its protection which
I may extend to the Chipeway chiefs who may come down
with me in the spring; for were a dog to run to my lodge
for safety, his enemy must walk over me to hurt him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Here is a flag, which I wish to send to the
Gens de Feuilles, to show them they are not forgotten by
their father. I wish the comrade of their chief to take it on
himself to deliver it with my words.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I am told that hitherto the traders have made
a practice of selling rum to you. All of you in your right
senses must know that it is injurious, and occasions quarrels,
murders, etc., amongst yourselves. For this reason
your father has thought proper to prohibit the traders from
selling you any rum. Therefore, I hope my brothers the
chiefs, when they know of a trader who sells an Indian rum,
will prevent that Indian from paying his [that trader's]
credit. This will break up the pernicious practice and oblige
your father. But I hope you will not encourage your young
men to treat our traders ill from this circumstance, or from
a hope of the indulgence formerly experienced; but make
your complaints to persons in this country, who will be
authorized to do you justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I now present you with some of your father's
tobacco and other trifling things, as a memorandum of my
good will; and before my departure I will give you some
liquor to clear your throats.

<p>Whereas, at a conference held between the United States
of America and the Sioux nation of Indians: lieutenant
Z. M. Pike, of the army of the United States, and the chiefs
and the warriors of said tribe, have agreed to the following
articles, which, when ratified and approved of by the proper
authority, shall be binding on both parties.</p>

<p><i>Art. 1.</i> That the Sioux nation grant unto the United
States, for the purpose of establishment of military posts,
nine miles square at the mouth of the St. Croix,<a name="FNanchor_ON-2" id="FNanchor_ON-2" href="#Footnote_ON-2" class="fnanchor">[*]</a> also from
below the confluence of the Mississippi and St. Peters up

<h3><i>Art. 6. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (Orig. No. 4, pp. 9-13.)</i></h3>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">St. Peters, Nine Miles below the Falls<br />
of St. Anthony</span>, Sept. 23d, 1805.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>I arrived here two days since, but shall not be able to
depart before day after to-morrow. Three of my men have
been up to view the falls, but their reports are so contradictory
that no opinion can be formed from them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>All the young warriors of the two villages of Sioux near
this place, and many chiefs, had marched against the Chipeways,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234-36</a></span>
to revenge a stroke made on their people, the very
day after their return from their visit to the Illinois; ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a></span>
persons were then killed on this ground. I yesterday saw
the mausoleum in which all their bodies are deposited, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a></span>
which is yet daily marked with the blood of those who
swear to revenge them. But a runner headed them, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237-239</a></span>
yesterday they all arrived&mdash;about 250 persons, in company
with those who were in the ponds gathering rice. Amidst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a></span>
the yelling of the mourners and the salutes of the warriors
there was a scene worthy the pen of a Robertson [qu. Rev.
Wm. Robertson, the Scottish historian, b. 1721, d. 1793?]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a></span></p>

<p>To-day I held a council on the beach, and made them a
speech, in which I touched on a variety of subjects; but the
principal points were, obtaining the lands as specified in the
within articles,<a name="FNanchor_V-7" id="FNanchor_V-7" href="#Footnote_V-7" class="fnanchor">[V-7]</a> making peace with the Chipeways, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
granting such [Chipeway] chiefs as might accompany me
down to visit you a safe conduct through their [Sioux]
country. These ends were accomplished. You will perceive
that we have obtained about 100,000 acres for a song.
You will please to observe, General, that the 2d article, relative
to consideration, is blank. The reasons for it were as
follows: I had to fee privately two of the chiefs, and beside
that to make them presents at the council of articles which
would in this country be valued at $200, and the others
about $50; part of these things were private property purchased
here, such as a few scarlet shrouds [strouds], etc.
These I was not furnished by the United States; and although
the chiefs in the council presented me with the land,
yet it is possible your Excellency may think proper to insert
the amount of those articles as the considerations to be
specified in Article 2d. They have bound me up to many
assurances that the posts shall be established; also, that
if the Chipeways are obstinate, and continue to kill the
Indians who bear our flags (the Chipeways on the Upper
Mississippi bearing the English flag) and our traders, we will
take them in hand and teach them to lay down the hatchet,
as we have once already done. This I was the rather induced
to say, as there were some persons present who,
although trading under your licenses, I know to be British
subjects. A chief by the name of Elan Levie [Ãlan LevÃ©<a name="FNanchor_V-8" id="FNanchor_V-8" href="#Footnote_V-8" class="fnanchor">[V-8]</a>],
then told me to look round on those young warriors on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
beach; that not only they, but those of six villages more,
were at our command. If possible, I will endeavor to note
down their several speeches, and show them you on my
return.</p>

<p>I have not a doubt of making Lake Sable [Sandy lake] in
pretty good season; but they inform me the source of the
river is in Lake La Sang Sue [Leech lake], about 60 leagues
further. This I must also see, and hope the General approves
of my determination. At those two lakes there are
establishments of the N. W. Company. These are both in
our country, and time and circumstances only can determine
in what manner I shall conduct myself toward them.<a name="FNanchor_ON-3" id="FNanchor_ON-3" href="#Footnote_ON-3" class="fnanchor">[*]</a>Mr.
[Hugh] M'Gillis, whose father was a refugee and had his
estate confiscated by the Americans, has charge of those
factories. He, they say, is a sworn enemy of the United
States. This was told me by a man who I expect was a
friend of the N. W. Company; but it had quite a contrary
effect to what he intended it to have, as I am determined,
should he attempt anything malicious toward me&mdash;open
force he dare not&mdash;to spare no pains to punish him. In
fact, the dignity and honor of our government requires that
they should be taught to gather their skins in quiet, but
even then not in a clandestine manner. Added to this, they
are the very instigators of the war between the Chipeways
and Sioux, in order that they may monopolize the trade of
the Upper Mississippi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_ON-3" id="Footnote_ON-3" href="#FNanchor_ON-3"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> Incorrect&mdash;he being a Scotchman, a gentleman, and a man of honor; but
this was the information I received at the St. Peters. [Orig. Note.]</p>

<p>The chiefs who were at Saint Louis this spring gave up
their English medals to Mr. Chouteau. He promised them
to obtain American medals in return, and send them up by
some officer. They applied to me for them, and said they
were their commissions&mdash;their only distinguishing mark
from the other warriors. I promised them that I would
write you on the occasion, and that you would remedy the
evil. The chiefs were very loath to sign the articles relative
to the land, asserting that their word of honor for the gift
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
was sufficient, that it was an impeachment of their probity
to require them to bind themselves further, etc. This is a
small sample of their way of thinking.</p>

<p>I must mention something to your Excellency relative to
the man recommended to me by Mr. Chouteau as interpreter.
At the time he solicited this employ he was engaged
to Mr. [Robert] Dickson, and on my arrival at the Prairie
[du Chien] was gone up the St. Peters. I understand he is
to be recommended for the appointment of interpreter to
the United States in this quarter. On the contrary, I beg
leave to recommend for that appointment Mr. Joseph Reinville,
who served as interpreter for the Sioux last spring at
the Illinois, and who has gratuitously and willingly, by permission
of Mr. [James] Frazer, to whom he is engaged,
served as my interpreter in all my conferences with the
Sioux. He is a man respected by the Indians, and I believe
an honest one. I likewise beg leave to recommend to your
attention Mr. Frazer, one of the two gentlemen who dined
with you, and was destined for the Upper Mississippi. He
waited eight or ten days at Prairie [du Chien] for me,
detained his interpreter, and thenceforward has continued
to evince a zeal to promote the success of my expedition by
every means in his power. He is a Vermonter born, and,
although not possessing the advantages of a polished education,
inherits that without which an education serves but to
add to frivolity of character&mdash;candor, bravery, and that <i>amor
patria</i> which distinguishes the good of every nation, from
Nova Zembla to the [Equatorial] line.</p>

<p>Finding that the traders were playing the devil with their
rum, I yesterday in council informed the Indians that their
father had prohibited the selling of liquor to them, and that
they would oblige him and serve themselves if they would
prevent their young men from paying the credits of any
trader who sold rum to them, at the same time charging the
chiefs to treat them well; as their father, although good,
would not again forgive them, but punish with severity any
injuries committed on their traders. This, I presume, General,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
is agreeable to the spirit of the laws. Mr. Frazer immediately
set the example, by separating his spirits from the
merchandise in his boats, and returning it to the Prairie,
although it would materially injure him if the other traders
retained and sold theirs. In fact, unless there are some
persons at our posts here, when established, who have
authority effectually to stop the evil by confiscating the
liquors, etc., it will still be continued by the weak and
malevolent.</p>

<p>I shall forbear giving you a description of this place until
my return, except only to observe that the position for this
post is on the point [where Fort Snelling now stands],
between the two rivers, which equally commands both; and
for that at the St. Croix, on the hill on the lower side of the
entrance, on the E. bank of the Mississippi [now Prescott,
Pierce Co., Wis.]. Owing to cloudy weather, etc., I have
taken no observation here; but the head of Lake Pepin is
in 44Â° 58Â´ 8Â´Â´ N., and we have made very little northing
since. The Mississippi is 130 yards wide, and the St. Peters
80 yards at their confluence.</p>

<p><i>Sept. 24th.</i> This morning Little Corbeau came to see me
from the village, he having recovered an article which I suspected
had been taken by the Indians. He told me many
things which the ceremony of the council would not permit
his delivering there; and added, he must tell me that Mr.
Roche, who went up the river St. Peters, had in his presence
given two kegs of rum to the Indians. The chief asked him
why he did so, as he knew it was contrary to the orders of
his father, adding that Messrs. Mareir and Tremer<a name="FNanchor_V-9" id="FNanchor_V-9" href="#Footnote_V-9" class="fnanchor">[V-9]</a> had left
their rum behind them, but that he alone had rum, contrary
to orders. Roche then gave the chief 15 bottles of rum,
as I suppose to bribe him to silence. I presume he should
be taught the impropriety of his conduct when he applies
for his license next year.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Above the Falls of St. Anthony</span>, Sept. 26th.</p>

<p>The cloudy weather still continues, and I have not been
able to take the latitude. Mr. Frazer has been kind enough
to send two of his people across from the Sioux town on the
St. Peters for my dispatches, and the place being dangerous
for them, I must haste to dispatch them. Of course, General,
the following short sketch of the falls will merely be
from <i>le coup d'&oelig;uil</i>. The place where the river falls over the
rocks appears to be about 15 feet perpendicular, the sheet
being broken by one large island on the E. and a small one
on the W., the former commencing below the shoot and
extending 500 yards above; the river then falls through a
continued bed of rocks, with a descent of at least 50 feet
perpendicular in the course of half a mile. Thence to the
St. Peters, a distance of 11 miles by water, there is almost
one continued rapid, aggravated by the interruption of 12
small islands. The carrying-place has two hills, one of 25
feet, the other of 12, with an elevation of 45Â°, and is about
three-fourths of a mile in length. Above the shoot, the
river is of considerable width; but below, at this time, I
can easily cast a stone over it. The rapid or suck continues
about half a mile above the shoot, when the water
becomes calm and deep. My barges are not yet over, but
my trucks are preparing, and I have not the least doubt
of succeeding.</p>

<p>The general, I hope, will pardon the tautologies and
egotisms of my communications, as he well knows Indian
affairs are productive of such errors, and that in a wilderness,
detached from the civilized world, everything, even if
of little import, becomes magnified in the eyes of the
beholder. When I add that my hands are blistered in
working over the rapids, I presume it will apologize for the
manner and style of my communications.</p>

<p>I flatter myself with hearing from you at the Prairie, on
my way down.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Pine Creek Rapids</span>, Oct. 1st, 1805.</p>

<p>You are to remain here with the party under your command,
subject to the following instructions: Your guards
to consist of one non-commissioned officer and three privates,
yourself mounting in regular rotation, making one
sentinel by day and by night; until your position is inclosed
by pickets, every man is to be employed on that object;
after which Sparks is to be employed in hunting; but this
will by no means excuse him from his tour of guard at night
when in the stockade, but he must be relieved during the
day by another man.</p>

<p>Should any Indians visit you previous to having your
works complete, divide your men between the two blockhouses,
and on no conditions suffer a savage to enter the
one where the stores are, and not more than one or two into
the other; but should you be so fortunate as not to be discovered
until your works are completed, you may admit
three, without arms, and no more, to enter at once, at the
same time always treating them with as much friendship as
is consistent with your own safety.</p>

<p>You are furnished with some tobacco to present them
with, but on no condition are you ever to give them one
drop of liquor; inform them that I have taken it all with me.
From the arrangements I have made with the Sioux it is
presumable they will treat you with friendship; but the
Chipeways may be disposed to hostilities, and, should you
be attacked, calculate on surrendering only with your life.
Instruct your men not to fire at random, nor ever, unless the
enemy is near enough to make him a point-blank shot. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
you must particularly attend to, and punish the first man
found acting in contradiction thereto. The greatest economy
must be used with the ammunition and provisions. Of
the latter I shall furnish Sparks his proportion; and at any
time should a man accompany him for a day's hunt, furnish
him with four or five balls and extra powder, and on his
return take what is left away from him. The provisions
must be issued agreeably to the following proportion: For
four days N. 80 lbs. of fresh venison, elk, or buffalo, or 60
lbs. fresh bear meat, with one quart of salt for that period.
The remainder of what is killed keep frozen in the open air
as long as possible, or salt and smoke it, so as to lay up meat
for my party and us all to descend the river with. If you
are obliged, through the failure of your hunter, to issue out
of our reserved provisions, you will deliver, for four days, 18
lbs. of pork or bacon, and 18 lbs. of flour only. This will be
sufficient, and must in no instance be exceeded. No whisky
will be issued after the present barrel is exhausted, at half a
gill per man per day.</p>

<p>Our boats are turned up near your gate. You will make
a barrel of pitch, and give them a complete repairing to be
ready for us to descend in.</p>

<p>I have delivered to you my journals and observations to
this place, with a letter accompanying them to his Excellency,
General James Wilkinson, which, should I not return
by the time hereafter specified, you will convey to him and
deliver personally, requesting his permission to deliver the
others committed to your charge.</p>

<p>You will observe the strictest discipline and justice in your
command. I expect the men will conduct themselves in
such a manner that there will be no complaints made on my
return, and that they will be ready to account to a higher
tribunal. The date of my return is uncertain; but let no
information or reports, except from under my own hand,
induce you to quit this place until one month after the ice
has broken up at the head of the river; when, if I am not
arrived, it will be reasonable to suppose that some disastrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
events detain us, and you may repair to St. Louis. You are
taught to discriminate between my baggage and United
States' property. The latter deliver to the assistant military
agent at St. Louis, taking his receipts for the same; the
former, if in your power, to Mrs. Pike.</p>

<p>Your party is regularly supplied with provisions, to include
the 8th of December only, from which time you are entitled
to draw on the United States.</p>

<h3><i>Art. 8. Letter, Pike to Hugh M'Gillis. (Orig. No. 5,
pp. 14-16.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">N. W. Establishment on Leech Lake</span>,
Feb. [6th], 1805.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>As [you are] a proprietor of the N. W. Company and
director of the Zond [Fond] du Lac department, I conceive
it my duty as an officer of the United States, in whose territory
you are, to address you solely on the subject of the
many houses under your instructions. As a member of the
greatest commercial nation in the world, and of a company
long renowned for their extent of connections and greatness
of views, you cannot be ignorant of the rigor of the laws of
the duties on imports of a foreign power.</p>

<p>Mr. Jay's treaty, it is true, gave the right of trade with the
savages to British subjects in the United States territories,
but by no means exempted them from paying the duties,
obtaining licenses, and subscribing unto all the rules and
restrictions of our laws. I find your establishments at every
suitable place along the whole extent of the south side of
Lake Superior to its head, thence to the source of the Mississippi,
and down Red River, and even extending to the
center of our newly acquired territory of Louisiana, in which
it will probably yet become a question between the two governments,
whether our treaties will authorize British subjects
to enter into the Indian trade on the same footing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
in the other parts of our frontiers, this not having been an
integral part of the United States at the time of said treaty.
Our traders to the south, on the Lower Mississippi, complain
to our government, with justice, that the members of
the N. W. Company encircle them on the frontiers of our
N. W. territory, and trade with the savages upon superior
terms to what they can afford, who pay the duties on their
goods imported from Europe, and subscribe to the regulations
prescribed by law.</p>

<p>These representations have at length attracted the attention
of our government to the object in question, and, with
an intention to do themselves as well as citizens justice, they
last year took some steps to ascertain the facts and make
provision against the growing evil. With this, and also with
some geographical and local objects in view, was I dispatched
with discretionary orders, with a party of troops, to the
source of the Mississippi. I have found, Sir, your commerce
and establishments extending beyond our most exaggerated
ideas; and in addition to the injury done our revenue
by evasion of the duties, other acts done which are more
particularly injurious to the honor and dignity of our government.
The transactions alluded to are the presenting
medals of his Britannic Majesty, and flags of the said government,
to the chiefs and warriors resident in the territory
of the United States. As political subjects are strictly prohibited
to our traders, what would be the ideas of the executive
to see foreigners making chiefs, and distributing flags,
the standard of an European power? The savages being
accustomed to look on that standard, which was the
only prevailing one for years, as that which alone has
authority in the country, it would not be in the least astonishing
to see them revolt from the United States' limited
subjection which is claimed over them by the American
government, and thereby be the cause of their receiving a
chastisement which, although necessary, yet would be unfortunate,
as they would have been led astray by the policy of
the traders of your country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>

<p>I must likewise observe, Sir, that your establishments, if
properly known, would be looked on with an eye of dissatisfaction
by our government, for another reason, viz., there
being so many furnished posts, in case of a rupture between
the two powers the English government would not fail to
make use of those as places of deposit of arms, ammunition,
etc., to be distributed to the savages who joined their arms,
to the great annoyance of our territory, and the loss of the
lives of many of our citizens. Your flags, Sir, when hoisted
in inclosed works, are in direct contradiction of the law of
nations, and their practice in like cases, which only admits
of foreign flags being expanded on board of vessels, and
at the residences of ambassadors or consuls. I am not
ignorant of the necessity of your being in such a position
as to protect yourself from the sallies of drunken savages,
or the more deliberate plans of intending plunderers;
and under those considerations have I considered your
stockades.</p>

<p>You, and the company of which you are a member, must
be conscious from the foregoing statement that strict justice
would demand, and I assure you that the law directs, under
similar circumstances, a total confiscation of your property,
personal imprisonment, and fines. But having discretionary
instructions and no reason to think the above conduct to be
dictated through ill-will or disrespect to our government,
and conceiving it in some degree departing from the
character of an officer to embrace the first opportunity of
executing those laws, I am willing to sacrifice my prospect
of private advantage, conscious that the government looks
not to its interest, but to its dignity in the transaction. I
have therefore to request of you assurances on the following
heads which, setting aside the chicanery of law, as a
gentleman you will strictly adhere to:</p>

<p>1st. That you will make representations to your agents,
at your headquarters on Lake Superior, of the quantity of
goods wanted the ensuing spring for your establishments in
the territory of the United States, in time sufficient (or as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
early as possible) for them to enter them at the C. H. of
Michilimackinac, and obtain a clearance and license to trade
in due form.</p>

<p>2d. That you will give immediate instructions to all the
posts in said territory under your direction, at no time and
under no pretense whatever to hoist, or suffer to be hoisted,
the English flag. If you conceive a flag necessary, you
may make use of that of the United States, which is the
only one which can be admitted.</p>

<p>3d. That you will on no further occasion present a flag
or medal to an Indian, or hold councils with any of them
on political subjects, or others foreign from that of trade;
but that, on being applied to on those heads, you will refer
them to the American agents, informing them that these
are the only persons authorized to hold councils of a political
nature with them.</p>

<p>There are many other subjects, such as the distribution
of liquor, etc., which would be too lengthy to be treated of
in detail. But the company will do well to furnish themselves
with our laws regulating commerce with the savages,
and regulate themselves in our territories accordingly.</p>

<p>I embrace this opportunity to acknowledge myself and
command under singular obligations to yourself and agents
for the assistance which you have rendered us, and the
polite treatment with which we have been honored. With
sentiments of high respect for the establishment and
yourself,</p>

<h3><i>Art. 9. Letter, Hugh M'Gillis to Pike. (Orig. No. 6,
pp. 17-19.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Leech Lake</span>, Feb. 15th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Your address presented on the 6th inst. has attracted my
most serious consideration to the several objects of duties
on importations; of presents made to, and our consultations
with, Indians; of inclosing our stores and dwelling-houses;
and finally, of the custom obtaining to hoist the British
flag in the territory belonging to the United States of
America. I shall at as early a period as possible present
the agents of the N. W. Company with your representations
regarding the paying duties on the importation of goods to
be sent to our establishments within the bounds of the territory
of the United States, as also their being entered at the
custom house of Michilimackinac; but I beg to be allowed
to present for consideration, that the major part of the
goods necessary to be sent to the said establishments for
the trade of the ensuing year, are now actually in our stores
at Kamanitiguia, our headquarters on Lake Superior, and
that it would cause us vast expense and trouble to be
obliged to convey those goods back to Michilimackinac to
be entered at the custom-house office. We therefore pray
that the word of gentlemen with regard to the quantity and
quality of the said goods, to be sent to said establishment,
may be considered as equivalent to the certainty of a custom-house
register. Our intention has never been to injure
your traders, paying the duties established by law. We
hope those representations to your government respecting
our concerns with the Indians may have been dictated with
truth, and not exaggerated by envy to prejudice our interests
and to throw a stain on our character which may require
time to efface from the minds of a people to whom we must
ever consider ourselves indebted for that lenity of procedure
of which the present is so notable a testimony. The inclosures
to protect our stores and dwelling-houses from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
insults and barbarity of savage rudeness, have been erected
for the security of my property and person in a country,
till now, exposed to the wild will of the frantic Indians.
We never formed the smallest idea that the said inclosures
might ever be useful in the juncture of a rupture between
the two powers, nor do we now conceive that such poor
shifts will ever be employed by the British government in
a country overshadowed with wood so adequate to every
purpose. Forts might in a short period of time be built
far superior to any stockades we may have occasion to
erect.</p>

<p>We were not conscious, Sir, of the error I acknowledge
we have been guilty of committing, by exhibiting to view
on your territory any standard of Great Britain. I will
pledge myself to your government, that I will use my
utmost endeavors, as soon as possible, to prevent the future
display of the British flag, or the presenting of medals, or
the exhibiting to public view any other mark of European
power, throughout the extent of territory known to belong
to the dominion of the United States. The custom has
long been established and we innocently and inoffensively,
as we imagined, have conformed to it till the present
day.</p>

<p>Be persuaded that on no consideration shall any Indian
be entertained on political subjects, or on any affairs foreign
to our trade; and that reference shall be made to the
American agents, should any application be made worthy
such reference. Be also assured that we, as a commercial
company, must find it ever our interests to interfere as little
as possible with affairs of government in the course of
trade, ignorant as we are in this rude and distant country
of the political views of nations.</p>

<p>We are convinced that the inestimable advantages arising
from the endeavors of your government to establish a more
peaceful course of trade in this part of the territory belonging
to the United States are not acquired through the mere
liberality of a nation, and we are ready to contribute to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
expense necessarily attending them. We are not averse to
paying the common duties established by law, and will ever
be ready to conform ourselves to all rules and regulations
of trade that may be established according to common
justice.</p>

<p>I beg to be allowed to say that we have reason to hope
that every measure will be adopted to secure and facilitate
the trade with the Indians; and these hopes seem to be
confirmed beyond the smallest idea of doubt, when we see
a man sent among us who, instead of private considerations
to pecuniary views, prefers the honor, dignity, and lenity of
his government, and whose transactions are in every respect
so conformable to equity. When we behold an armed
force ready to protect or chastise as necessity or policy may
direct, we know not how to express our gratitude to that
people whose only view seems to be to promote the happiness
of all, the savages that rove over the wild confines of
their domains not excepted.</p>

<p>It is to you, Sir, we feel ourselves most greatly indebted,
whose claim to honor, esteem, and respect will ever be held
in high estimation by myself and associates. The danger
and hardships, by your fortitude vanquished and by your
perseverance overcome, are signal, and will ever be preserved
in the annals of the N. W. Company. Were it solely from
consideration of those who have exposed their lives in a
long and perilous march through a country where they had
every distress to suffer, and many dangers to expect,&mdash;and
this with a view to establish peace in a savage country,&mdash;we
should think ourselves under the most strict obligation to
assist them. But we know we are in a country where hospitality
and gratitude are to be considered above every
other virtue, and therefore have offered for their relief what
our poor means will allow: and, Sir, permit me to embrace
this opportunity to testify that I feel myself highly honored
by your acceptance of such accommodations as my humble
roof could afford.</p>

<p>With great consideration and high respect for the government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
of the United States, allow me to express my esteem
and regard for yourself.</p>

<p class="left45">I am, Sir,<br />
<span class="i2">Your obedient humble servant,</span><br />

<h3><i>Art. 10. Speech, Pike to the Sauteaux, in a Council at Leech
Lake, Feb. 16th, 1806. (Orig. No. 7, pp. 19-22.)</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: A few months since the Spaniards shut up
the mouth of the Mississippi, and prevented the Americans
from floating down to the sea. This your father, the President
of the United States, would not admit of. He therefore
took such measures as to open the river, remove the
Spaniards from both sides of the Mississippi to a great distance
on the other side of the Missouri, and open the road
from the ocean of the east to that of the west. The Americans
being then at peace with all the world, your great
father, the President of the United States, began to look
round on his red children, in order to see what he could do
to render them happy and sensible of his protection. For
that purpose he sent two of his Captains, Lewis and Clark,
up the Missouri, to pass on to the west sea, in order to see
all his new children, to go round the world that way, and
return by water. They stayed the first winter at the Mandane's<a name="FNanchor_V-11" id="FNanchor_V-11" href="#Footnote_V-11" class="fnanchor">[V-11]</a>
village, where you might have heard of them. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
year your great father directed his great war-chief (General
Wilkinson) at St. Louis, to send a number of his young
warriors up the Missouri, Illinois, Osage River, and other
courses, to learn the situation of his red children, to encourage
the good, punish the bad, and make peace between them
all by persuading them to lay by the hatchet and follow the
young warriors to St. Louis, where the great war-chief will
open their ears that they may hear the truth, and their eyes,
to see what is right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I was chosen to ascend the Mississippi, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
bear to his red children the words of their father; and the
Great Spirit has opened the eyes and ears of all the nations
that I have passed to listen to my words. The Sauks and
Reynards are planting corn and raising cattle. The Winnebagos
continue peaceable, as usual, and even the Sioux have
laid by the hatchet at my request. Yes, my brothers,
the Sioux, who have so long and so obstinately waged war
against the Chipeways, have agreed to lay by the hatchet,
smoke the calumet, and become again your brothers, as they
were wont to be.<a name="FNanchor_V-12" id="FNanchor_V-12" href="#Footnote_V-12" class="fnanchor">[V-12]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: You behold the pipe of Wabasha as a proof
of what I say. Little Corbeau, Tills [Fils] De Pinchow, and
L'Aile Rouge had marched 250 warriors to revenge the
blood of their women and children, slain last year at the St.
Peters. I sent a runner after them, stopped their march,
and met them in council at the mouth of the St. Peters,
where they promised to remain peaceable until my return;
and if the Ouchipawah [Chippewa] chiefs accompanied me,
to receive them as brothers and accompany us to St. Louis,
there to bury the hatchet and smoke the pipe in the presence
of our great war-chief; and to request him to punish
those who first broke the peace.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I sent flags and a message up the St. Peters
to the bands of Sioux on that river, requesting them to
remain quiet, and not to go to war. The People of the
Leaves [Gens des Feuilles] received my message and sent
me word that they would obey; but the Yanctongs and
Sussitongs had left the St. Peters previous to my message
arriving, and did not receive it. When I left my fort they
had appointed a day for 50 of their chiefs and warriors to
come and see me, but I could not wait for them; so that,
as to their dispositions for peace or war, I cannot answer
positively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I have therefore come to fetch some of your
approved chiefs with me to St. Louis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: In speaking to you I speak to brave warriors.
It is therefore not my intention to deceive you. Possibly
we may meet with some bad people who may wish to do us
ill; but if so, we will die together, certain that our fathers,
the Americans, will settle with them for our blood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I find you have received from your traders
English medals and flags. These you must deliver up, and
your chiefs who go with me shall receive others from the
American government, in their room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Traders have no authority to make chiefs;
and in doing this they have done what is not right. It is
only great chiefs, appointed by your fathers, who have that
authority. But at the same time you are under considerable
obligations to your traders, who come over large waters,
high mountains, and up swift falls, to supply you with
clothing for your women and children, and ammunition for
your hunters, to feed you, and keep you from perishing with
cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Your chiefs should see your traders done
justice, oblige your young men to pay their credits, and
protect them from insults; and your traders, on their part,
must not cheat the Indians, but give them the value of
their skins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Your father is going to appoint chiefs of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
own to reside among you, to see justice done to his white
and red children, who will punish those who deserve punishment,
without reference to the color of their skin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: I understand that one of your young men
killed an American at Red Lake last year, but the murderer
is far off. Let him keep so&mdash;send him where we
never may hear of him more; for were he here I would be
obliged to demand him of you, and make my young men
shoot him. My hands on this journey are yet clear of blood&mdash;may
the Great Spirit keep them so!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: We expect, in the summer, soldiers to come
to the St. Peters. Your chiefs who go with me may either
come up with them, or some traders who return sooner.
They may make their selection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: Your father finds that the rum with which
you are supplied by the traders is the occasion of quarrels,
murders, and bloodshed; and that, instead of buying
clothing for your women and children, you spend your skins
in liquor, etc. He has determined to direct his young
warriors and chiefs to prohibit it, and keep it from among
you. But I have found the traders here with a great deal
of rum on hand. I have therefore given them permission
to sell what they have, that you may forget it by degrees,
against next year, when none will be suffered to come in the
country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: I have heard and understood the words of

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
been present, and would have gone to see my father, the

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: This medal I hold in my hands I received
from the English chiefs. I willingly deliver it up to you.
Wabasha's calumet, with which I am presented, I receive
with all my heart. Be assured that I will use my best
endeavors to keep my young men quiet. There is my calumet.
I send it to my father the great war-chief. What
does it signify that I should go to see him? Will not my
pipe answer the same purpose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: You will meet with the Sioux on your
return. You will make them smoke my pipe, and tell them
that I have let fall my hatchet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: Tell the Sioux on the upper part of the
river St. Peters to mark trees with the figure of a calumet,
that we of Red Lake who may go that way, should we see
them, may make peace with them, being assured of their
pacific disposition when we see the calumet marked on the
trees.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>2d. The Chief de la Terre of Leech lake</i> (<i>Obigouitte</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: I am glad to hear that we and the Sioux
are now brothers, peace being made between us. If I have
received a medal from the English traders, it was not as
a mark of rank or distinction, as I considered it, but merely
because I made good hunts and paid my debts. Had Sucre
been able to go and see our father, the great war-chief,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
I should have accompanied him; but I am determined to
go to Michilimackinac next spring to see my brothers the
Americans.</p>

<p class="center p2"><i>3d. Geuelle Platte of Leech lake</i> (<i>Eskibugeckoge</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: My heart beat high with joy when I heard
that you had arrived, and that all the nations through which
you passed had received and made peace among them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: You ask me to accompany you to meet our
father, the great war-chief. This I would willingly do, but
certain considerations prevent me. I have sent my calumet
to all the Sauteaux who hunt round about, to assemble to
form a war-party; should I be absent, they, when assembled,
might strike those with whom we have made peace, and
thus kill our brothers. I must therefore remain here to
prevent them from assembling, as I fear that there are
many who have begun already to prepare to meet me. I
present you with the medal of my uncle here present. He
received it from the English chiefs as a recompense for his
good hunts. As for me, I have no medal here; it is at my
tent, and I will cheerfully deliver it up. That medal was
given me by the English traders, in consideration of something
that I had done; and I can say that three-fourths of
those here present belong to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My father</span>: I promise you, and you may confide in
my word, that I will preserve peace; that I bury my
hatchet; and that even should the Sioux come and strike
me, for the first time I would not take up my hatchet; but
should they come and strike me a second time, I would dig
up my hatchet and revenge myself.</p>

<p>Mr. Grant was prepared to go on a trading voyage among

means admit of, and I hope that, on a moment's reflection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
you will admit the justice of my refusal. For what could
be a greater piece of injustice than for me to permit you to
send goods, illegally brought into the country, down into
the same quarter, to trade for the credits of men who have
paid their duties, regularly taken out licenses, and in other
respects acted conformably to law? They might exclaim
with justice, "What! Lt. Pike, not content with suffering
the laws to slumber when it was his duty to have executed
them, has now suffered the N. W. Company's agents to come
even here to violate them, and injure the citizens of the

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>:</p>

<p>Being informed that you have arrived here with an intention
of selling spirituous liquors to the savages of this
quarter, together with other merchandise under your charge,
I beg leave to inform you that the sale of spirituous liquors
on the Indian territories, to any savages whatsoever, is contrary
to a law of the United States for regulating trade with
the savages and preserving peace on the frontiers; and that
notwithstanding the custom has hitherto obtained on the
Upper Mississippi, no person whatsoever has authority
therefor. As the practice may have a tendency to occasion
broils and dissensions among the savages, thereby occasioning
bloodshed and an infraction of the good understanding
which now, through my endeavors, so happily exists, I have,
at your particular request, addressed you this note in writing,
informing you that in case of an infraction I shall conceive
it my duty, as an officer of the United States, to prosecute
according to the pains and penalties of the law.</p>

<h3><i>Art. 14. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (Orig. No. 11, pp. 25, 26.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Prairie De Chien</span>, Apr. 18, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear General</span>:</p>

<p>I arrived here within the hour, and as Mr. Jearreau, of
Cahokia, embarks for St. Louis early to-morrow morning, I
embrace this opportunity to give a slight sketch of the
events of my expedition. Being obliged to steal the hours
from my repose, I hope the General will pardon the conciseness
of my epistle.</p>

<p>I pushed forward last October with all eagerness, in hopes
to make Lake De Sable, and return to St. Louis in the
autumn. The weather was mild and promising until the
middle of the month, when a sudden change took place and
the ice immediately commenced running. I was then conscious
of my inability to return, as the falls and other obstacles
would retain me until the river would close. I then
conceived it best to station part of my men, and push my
discovery with the remainder on foot. I marched with 11
soldiers and my interpreter, 700 miles, to the source of the
Mississippi, through (I may without vanity say) as many
hardships as almost any party of Americans ever experienced,
by cold and hunger. I was on the communication of Red
river and the Mississippi, the former being a water of Hudson's
bay.<a name="FNanchor_V-14" id="FNanchor_V-14" href="#Footnote_V-14" class="fnanchor">[V-14]</a> The British flag, which was expanded on some
very respectable positions, has given place to that of the
United States wherever we passed; likewise, we have the
faith and honor of the N. W. Company for about $13,000
duties this year; and by the voyage peace is established
between the Sioux and Sauteurs. These objects I have
been happy enough to accomplish without the loss of one
man, although once fired on. I expect hourly the Sussitongs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Yanctongs, Wachpecoutes, and three other bands of
Sioux; some are from the head of the St. Peters, and some
from the plains west of that river. From here I bring with
me a few of the principal men only, agreeably to your orders;
also, some chiefs of the Fols Avoins or Menomones, and
Winebagos, the latter of whom have murdered three men
since my passing here last autumn. The murderers I shall
demand, and am in expectation of obtaining two, for whom
I now have irons making, and expect to have them with me
on my arrival. Indeed, Sir, the insolence of the savages in
this quarter is unbounded; and unless an immediate example
is made, we shall certainly be obliged to enter into a
general war with them.</p>

<p>My party has been some small check to them this winter,
as I was determined to preserve the dignity of our flag, or
die in the attempt.</p>

<p>I presume, General, that my voyage will be productive of
much new, useful, and interesting information for our government,
although detailed in the unpolished diction of a
soldier of fortune.</p>

<p>The river broke up at my stockade, 600 miles above here,
on the 7th inst., and Lake Pepin was passable for boats only
on the 14th. Thus you may perceive, Sir, I have not been
slow in my descent, leaving all the traders behind me.
From the time it will take to make my arrangements, and
the state of the water, I calculate on arriving at the cantonment
[Belle Fontaine] on the 4th of May; and hope my
General will be assured that nothing but the most insurmountable
obstacles shall detain me one moment.</p>

<p>N. B. I beg leave to caution the General against attending
to the reports of any individuals relating to this country,
as the most unbounded prejudices and party rancor pervade
almost generally.</p>

Apr. 20th, 1806. (Part of Orig. No. 12, pp. 26, 27.)</i></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: When I passed here last autumn I requested
to see you on my return. I am pleased to see you have
listened to my words. It pleased the Great Spirit to open
the ears of all the nations through which I passed, to hear
and attend to the words of their father. Peace has been
established between two of the most powerful nations in
this quarter.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, some of your nation have been
bold enough to kill some of the white people. Not content
with firing on the canoes descending the Ouiscousing last
autumn, they have killed a man on Rock river, when sitting
peaceably in his tent. They have also recently murdered a
young man near this place, without any provocation whatever.
As an officer of the United States, it is my duty to
demand the murderers; and I do now demand them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brothers</span>: In this action I am not influenced or urged
by any individual of this place, or the people generally; no
more than as it is my duty to give all our citizens all the
protection in my power. I will not deceive you. If the
prisoners are delivered to me, I shall put them in irons,
under my guards, and in all instances treat them as men
guilty of a capital crime; on their arrival below, they will
be tried for their lives; and if it be proved they have killed
these people without provocation, in all probability they
will be put to death. If, on the contrary, it is proved that
the whites were the aggressors, and it was only self-defence,
it will be deemed justifiable, and they will be sent back to
their nation.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>It becomes you to consider well whether in case of a
refusal you are sufficiently powerful to protect these men
against the power of the United States, which have always,
since the treaty of 1795, treated all the savages as their
children; but if they are obliged to march troops to punish
the many murders committed on their citizens, then the
innocent will suffer with the guilty.</p>

<p>My demand will be reported in candor and truth below;
when the general will take such steps as he may deem
proper. But I hope, for the sake of your innocent women
and children, you will do us and yourselves justice. I was
directed to invite a few chiefs down with me to St. Louis.
Many of different bands are about to descend with me. I
now give an invitation to two or three of your principal
men to descend with me. Whatever are your determinations,
I pledge the faith of a soldier for a safe conduct back
to your nation. At present, I am not instructed to act by
force to procure those men, therefore you will consider
yourselves as acting without restraint, and under free deliberations.</p>

<p>They replied that they thanked me for the generous and
candid manner in which I had explained myself, and that
they would give me an answer to-morrow.</p>

<h3><i>Art. 16. Further Conferences with Indians at Prairie du
Chien, Apr. 21st, 1806. (Part of Orig. No. 12, pp. 27-29.)</i></h3>

<p>The Puants met me in council, agreeably to promise.
Karamone, their chief, addressed me, and said they had
come to reply to my demand of yesterday. He requested
that I, with the traders, would listen. A soldier called
Little Thunder then arose and said: "The chiefs were for
giving up the murderer present; but it was the opinion of
the soldiers that they should themselves take him with the
others to their father. But if I preferred their taking one
down now, they would do it; if, on the contrary, I expected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
all three, they would immediately depart in pursuit of the
others, and bring them all together to their father. That if
he did not bring them he would deliver himself up to the
Americans." I replied: "He must not attempt to deceive.
That I had before told him that I was not authorized to
seize their men by force of arms, but that I wished to know
explicitly the time when we might expect them at St. Louis,
in order that our general should know what steps to take
in case they did not arrive. That the consequence of a non-compliance
would be serious to themselves and their children.
Also that they had recently hoisted a British flag
near this place which, had I been here, I should have prevented.
I advised them to bring their British flags and
medals down to St. Louis, to deliver them up, and receive
others in exchange." Their reply was: "In ten days to the
Prairie, and thence to St. Louis in ten days more."</p>

<p>Held a council with the Sioux, in which the chiefs of the
Yanctongs, Sussitongs, Sioux of the head of the De Moyen,
and part of the Gens Du Lac were present. Wabasha first
spoke, in answer to my speech, wherein I had recapitulated
the conduct of the Sauteurs, their desire and willingness for
peace, their arrangements for next summer, the pipes they
had sent, etc. Also, the wish of the general for some of
the chiefs to descend below. Recommended the situation
and good intentions of the young chiefs at the mouth of
the St. Peters, to the others; and that they should give
them assistance to keep the bad men in awe.</p>

<p>They all acquiesced in the peace with the Sauteurs, but
said generally they doubted their bad faith, as they had
experienced it many a time. Nez Corbeau said he had been
accused of being hired to kill Mr. Dixon [Dickson], but he
here solemnly denied ever having been instigated to any
such action.</p>

<p>Tonnere Rouge then arose and said: Jealousy was in a
great measure the principal cause of his descending. That
if any trader ever had cause to complain of him, now let
him do it publicly. That last year an officer went up the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Missouri, gave flags and medals, made chiefs, and played
the devil and all. That this year liquor was restricted [forbidden]
to the Indians on the Louisiana side, and permitted
on this. He wished to know the reason of those arrangements.</p>

<p>I replied that the officer who ascended the Missouri was
authorized by their father; and that to make chiefs of them,
etc., was what I now invited them down for. As to liquor,
it was too long an explanation to give them here, but it
would be explained to them below; and that in a very short
time liquor would be restricted on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>The Puants in the evening came to the house, and Macraragah,
alias Merchant, spoke: That last spring he had
embarked to go down to St. Louis; but at De Buques
[Dubuque's] the Reynards gave back. That when he saw
me last autumn he gave me his hand without shame; but
since it had pleased the father of life to cover them with
shame, they now felt themselves miserable. They implored
me to present their flags and medals to the general, as a
proof of their good intentions; and when I arrived at St.
Louis, to assure the general they were not far behind. The
chiefs and the soldiers would follow with the murderers;
but begged I would make their road clear, etc. Delivered
his pipe and flag.</p>

<p>Karamone then spoke, with apparent difficulty; assured
me of the shame, disgrace, and distress of their nation, and
that he would fulfill what the others had said; said that he
sent by me the medal of his father, which he considered
himself no longer worthy to wear&mdash;putting it around my
neck, trembling&mdash;and begged me to intercede with the
general in their favor, etc.</p>

<p>I assured him that the American was a generous nation,
not confounding the innocent with the guilty; that when
they had delivered up the three or four dogs who had
covered them with blood, we would again look on them as
our children; advised them to take courage that, if they
did well, they should be treated well; said that I would tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the general everything relative to the affair; also, their
repentance, and determination to deliver themselves and
the murderers, and that I would explain about their flags
and medals.</p>

<p class="left45">
<span class="smcap">Prairie des Chiens</span>, Apr. 20th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>:</p>

<p>Having demanded of the Puants the authors of the late
atrocious murders, and understanding that it is their intention
to deliver them to me, I have to request of you, as
magistrates of this territory, that you will have all the
depositions of those facts taken which it is in your power
to procure; and if at any future period, previous to the final
decisions of their fate, further proofs can be obtained, that
you will have them properly authenticated and forwarded
to his Excellency, General Wilkinson.</p>

<h3><i>Art. 18. Letter, Pike to Wilkinson. (Orig. No. 14,
pp. 30, 31.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Fort St. Louis</span>, May 26th, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have hitherto detained the medals and flags, intending
to present them to you at the final conclusion of my
vouchers on the subject of my correspondence with the
savages. But in order that the general might know of
whom I had obtained medals and flags, I gave him a memorandum
when I handed in my vouchers on the subject of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the N. W. Company. Now I have thought proper to send
them by the bearer, marked with the names of the chiefs
from whom I obtained them.</p>

<p>I also send you a pipe and beaver robe of Tonnere Rouge,
as they are the handsomest of any which I received on the
whole route. I have several other pipes, two sacks, and one
robe; but as they bore no particular message, I conceived
the general would look on it as a matter of no consequence;
indeed, none except the Sauteurs' [presents] were accompanied
by a talk, but just served as an emblem of the good
will of the moment. I likewise send the skins of the lynx
and brelaw [badger], as the general may have an opportunity
to forward them.</p>

<p>Some gentlemen have promised me a mate for my dog;
if I obtain him, the pair, or the single one with the sleigh,
is at the general's service, to be transmitted to the States as
we determined on doing. I mentioned in my memorandums
the engagements I was under relative to the flags or medals,
and should any early communications be made to that
country, I hope the subject may not be forgotten. I have
labeled each article with the name of those from whom
I obtained them; also the names of the different animals.</p>

<p class="left45">I am, sir,<br />
<span class="i2">With esteem and high consideration,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="i6">[Signed]   <span class="smcap">Z. M. Pike</span>, Lt.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">General James Wilkinson.</span></p>

<p>My faith was pledged to the savage chiefs for the replacing
of the medals and flags of the British government which
they surrendered me, by others of the same magnitude of
the United States; but owing to the change of agents, and
a variety of circumstances, it was never fulfilled. This has
left a number of the Sioux and Sauteur chiefs without their
distinguishing marks of dignity, and has induced them to
look on my conduct toward them as a premeditated fraud.
This would render my life in danger should I ever return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
amongst them, and the situation of any other officer who
should presume to make a similar demand extremely delicate;
besides, it has compromitted with those savage warriors
the <i>faith</i> of our government, which, to enable any
government ever to do good, should be held inviolate.<a name="FNanchor_V-16" id="FNanchor_V-16" href="#Footnote_V-16" class="fnanchor">[V-16]</a></p>

pp. 31-33.)</i></h3>

<p class="left45"><span class="smcap">Bellefontaine</span>, July 2d, 1806.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>I have at length finished all my reports, observations, and
journals, which arose from my late voyage to the source of
the Mississippi, and hope they may prove interesting, from
the information on different subjects which they contain.</p>

<p>I perceive that I differ materially from Captain Lewis<a name="FNanchor_V-18" id="FNanchor_V-18" href="#Footnote_V-18" class="fnanchor">[V-18]</a> in
my account of the numbers, manners, and morals of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Sioux. But our reception by that nation at the first interview
being so different, it no doubt left an impression on
our minds, which may have, unknown to ourselves, given
a cast to our observations. I will not only vouch for the
authenticity of my account as to numbers, arms, etc., from
my own notes, but from having had them revised and corrected
by a gentleman<a name="FNanchor_V-19" id="FNanchor_V-19" href="#Footnote_V-19" class="fnanchor">[V-19]</a> of liberal education, who has resided
18 years in that nation, speaks their language, and for some
years past has been collecting materials for their natural and
philosophical history.</p>

<p>I have not attempted to give an account of nations of
Indians whom I did not visit, except the Assinniboins, whom,
from their intimate connection with the Sioux, in a lineal
point of view, it would have been improper to leave out of
the catalogue.</p>

<p>The correctness of the geographical parts of the voyage
I will vouch for, as I spared neither time, fatigue, nor
danger, to see for myself every part connected with my
immediate route.</p>

<p>As the general already knows, at the time I left St. Louis
there were no instruments proper for celestial observations,
excepting those which he furnished me, which were inadequate
to taking the longitude; neither had I the proper
tables or authors to accomplish that object, though it can no
doubt be ascertained by various charts at different points of
my route. Nor had I proper time-pieces or instruments for
meteorological observations. Those made were from an
imperfect instrument which I purchased in the town of St.
Louis.</p>

<p>I do not possess the qualifications of the naturalist, and
even had they been mine, it would have been impossible
to gratify them to any great extent, as we passed with
rapidity over the country we surveyed, which was covered
with snow six months out of the nine I was absent. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
indeed, my thoughts were too much engrossed in making
provision for the exigencies of the morrow to attempt a
science which requires time, and a placidity of mind which
seldom fell to my lot.</p>

<p>The journal in itself will have little to strike the imagination,
being but a dull detail of our daily march, and
containing many notes which should have come into the
geographical part; others of observations on the savage
character, and many that were never intended to be included
in my official report.</p>

<p>The daily occurrences written at night, frequently by firelight,
when extremely fatigued, and the cold so severe as to
freeze the ink in my pen, of course have little claim to elegance
of expression or style; but they have truth to recommend
them, which, if always attended to, would strip the
pages of many of our journalists of their most interesting
occurrences.</p>

<p>The general will please to recollect also, that I had
scarcely returned to St. Louis before the [Arkansaw] voyage
now in contemplation was proposed to me; and that, after
some consideration my duty, and inclination in some respects,
induced me to undertake it. The preparations for
my new voyage prevented the possibility of my paying that
attention to the correction of my errors that I should otherwise
have done. This, with the foregoing reasons, will, I
hope, be deemed a sufficient apology for the numerous
errors, tautologies, and egotisms which will appear.</p>

<p class="left45">I am, dear General,<br />
<span class="i2">With great respect,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Your obedient servant,</span><br />

<i>Observations on the trade, views, and policy of the North
West Company, and the national objects connected with
their commerce, as it interests the Government of the
United States.</i><a name="FNanchor_VI-2" id="FNanchor_VI-2" href="#Footnote_VI-2" class="fnanchor">[VI-2]</a></p>

<p>The fur-trade in Canada has always been considered an
object of the first importance to that colony, and has
been cherished by the respective governors of that province
by every regulation in their power, under both the French
and English administrations. The great and almost unlimited
influence the traders of that country acquired over the
savages was severely felt, and will long be remembered by
the citizens on our frontiers. Every attention was paid by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
the cabinet of St. James, in our treaty with Great Britain, to
secure to their Canadian subjects the privilege of the Indian
trade within our territories, and with what judgment they
have improved the advantages obtained by the mother
country, time will soon unfold.</p>

<p>In the year 1766, the trade was first extended from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Michilimackinac, to the northwest, by a few desperate
adventurers, whose mode of life on the voyage, and short
residence in civilized society, obtained for them the appellation
of Coureurs des Bois. From those trifling beginnings
arose the present North West Company, who, notwithstanding
the repeated attacks made on their trade, have
withstood every shock, and are now, by the coalition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
late X. Y. Company, established on so firm a basis as to
bid defiance to every opposition which can be made by
private individuals.</p>

<p>They, by a late purchase of the king's posts in Canada,
extend their line of trade from Hudson's Bay to the St.
Lawrence, and up that river on both sides to the Lakes;
thence to the head of Lake Superior, at which place the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
North West Company have their headquarters; thence to
the source of Red river and all its tributary streams through
the country to the Missouri; through the waters of Lake
Winipie to the Saskashawin; on that river to its source;
up Elk river to the Lake of the Hills; up Peace river to
the Rocky mountains; from the Lake of the Hills [Lac des
Buttes, old French name of Lake Athapasca] up Slave river
to Slave Lake. This year they have dispatched a Mr. [(not
Sir) Alexander] Mackenzie on a voyage of trade and discovery
down Mackenzie's river to the north sea; and also a Mr.
M'Coy,<a name="FNanchor_VI-3" id="FNanchor_VI-3" href="#Footnote_VI-3" class="fnanchor">[VI-3]</a> to cross the Rocky mountains and proceed to the
western ocean with the same objects in view.</p>

<p>They have had a gentleman by the name of [David]
Thompson<a name="FNanchor_VI-4" id="FNanchor_VI-4" href="#Footnote_VI-4" class="fnanchor">[VI-4]</a> making a geographical survey of the northwest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
part of the continent; who, for three years, with an astonishing
spirit of enterprise and perseverance, passed over all
that extensive and unknown country. His establishment,
although not splendid, the mode of traveling not admitting
it, was such as to admit of unlimited expenses in everything
necessary to facilitate his inquiries; and he is now engaged
in digesting the important results of his enterprise.</p>

<p>I find from the observations and suggestions of Mr. Thompson,
when at the [Julian] source of the Mississippi, that it
was his opinion the line of limits between the United States
and Great Britain must run such a course from the head of
the Lake of the Woods as to touch the source of the Mississippi;
and this I discovered to be the opinion of the North
West Company, who, we may suppose or reasonably conclude,
speak the language held forth by their government.
The admission of this pretension will throw out of our
territory all the upper part of Red river, and nearly two-fifths
of the territory of Louisiana. Whereas, if the line be
run due west from the head of the Lake of the Woods, it
will cross Red river nearly at the entrance of Reed river,
and, it is conjectured, strike the western ocean at Birch Bay,
in Queen Charlotte Sound. Those differences of opinion, it
is presumed, might be easily adjusted between the two
governments at the present day; but it is believed that
delays, by unfolding the true value of the country, may
produce difficulties which do not at present exist.</p>

<p>The North West Company have made establishments at
several places on the south side of Lake Superior, and on
the head waters of the Sauteaux and St. Croix, which discharge
into the Mississippi. The first I met with on the
voyage up was at Lower Red Cedar Lake, about 150 miles
above Isle de Corfeau [Corbeau], on the east side of the
river, and distant therefrom six miles. It is situated on the
north point of the lake, and consists of log buildings, flanked
by picketed bastions on two of its angles. The next establishment
I met with was situated on Sandy Lake: for a
description of which, see document [herewith] marked A.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Midway between Sandy Lake and Leech Lake is a small
house not worthy of notice [Grant's: see <a href="#Footnote_II-52">note<sup>52</sup></a> p. 144].
On the southwest side of the latter lake, from the outlet of
the Mississippi, stand the headquarters of the Fond du Lac
department: for information relative to which, have reference
to document marked B. Here resides the director of
this department. In document C is a recapitulation of the
specific articles of 115 packs of peltry, which will give an
idea of the whole, amounting per said voucher to 233 packs
per annum in the Fond du Lac department. Document D
will explain the relative price of goods in that district; but
the trading prices are various, according to situations and
circumstances. Voucher E shows the number of men,
women, and children in the service of the North West
Company in the district aforesaid, with their pay per annum,
etc. This department brings in annually 40 canoes; from
which, by a calculation made by a gentleman [George
Anderson] of veracity and information, who has been 18
years in the Indian trade and in the habit of importing
goods by Michilimackinac, it appears that the annual
amount of duties would be about $13,000. The Lower
Red river, which I conceive to be within our territory, would
yield about half that sum, $6,500, and the Hudson Bay
Company's servants, who import by the way of Lake
Winipie, $6,500 more.</p>

<p>Thus is the United States defrauded annually of about
$26,000. From my observations and information, I think it
will be an easy matter to prevent the smuggling of the Fond
du Lac department, by establishing a post with a garrison
of 100 men, and an office of the customs, near the mouth of
the St. Louis, where all goods for the Fond du Lac department
must enter. This is at present the distributing point,
where the company have an establishment, and where the
goods, on being received from Kamanitiquia, are embarked
for their different destinations. That point also commands
the communication with Lake de Sable, Leech Lake, Red
Lake, etc. I am also of opinion that the goods for Red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
River, if it be within our boundary, would enter here, in
preference to being exposed to seizure. It is worthy of
remark that the charter of the Hudson's Bay Company
extends to all its waters: and if the British government conceived
they had authority to make such a grant, they certainly
would claim the country therein specified, which
would extend far south of the west line from the head of the
Lake of the Woods.</p>

<p>The North West Company were about to push their trade
down the Mississippi until they would have met the traders
of Michilimackinac; but I gave them to understand that
it could not be admitted, as appears per letter to Mr.
Dickson.</p>

<h3>A. <i>Description of the N. W. Company's Fort at Sandy Lake.</i></h3>

<p>The fort at Sandy Lake is situated on the S. side, near
the W. end, and is a stockade 100 feet square, with bastions
at the S. E. and N. W. angles, pierced for small-arms. The
pickets are squared on the outside, round within, about one
foot diameter, and 13 feet above ground. There are three
gates: the principal one fronts the lake on the N., and is
10 Ã 9 feet; the one on the W. 6 Ã 4 feet; and the one on the
E. 6 Ã 5 feet. As you enter by the main gate you have on
the left a building of one story, 20 feet square, the residence
of the superintendent. Opposite this house on the left of
the E. gate, is a house 25 Ã 15 feet, the quarters of the men.
On entering the W. gate you find the storehouse on the
right, 30 Ã 20 feet, and on your left a building 40 Ã 20 feet,
which contains rooms for clerks, a workshop, and provision
store.</p>

<p>On the W. and N. W. is a picketed inclosure of about four
acres, in which last year they raised 400 bushels of Irish
potatoes, cultivating no other vegetables. In this inclosure
is a very ingeniously constructed vault to contain the potatoes,
and which likewise has secret apartments to conceal
liquors, dry goods, etc.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<h3>B. <i>Description of the N. W. Company's Fort at Leech Lake.</i></h3>

<p>The fort is situated on the W. side of the lake, in lat.
47Â° 16Â´ 13Â´Â´ N. It is built near the shore, on the declivity
of a rising ground, having an inclosed garden of about 5
acres on the N. W. It is a square stockade of 150 feet, the
pickets being 16 feet in length, 3 feet under and 13 feet
above the ground, bound together by horizontal bars each
10 feet long. Pickets of 10 feet are likewise driven into the
ground on the inside of the work, opposite the apertures
between the large pickets. At the W. and E. angles are
square bastions, pierced for fire-arms.</p>

<p>The main building in the rear, fronting the lake, is 60 Ã 25
feet, 1Â½ story high; the W. end of this is occupied by the
director of the Fond du Lac department. He has a hall 18
feet square, bed-room, and kitchen, with an office. The
center is a trading shop of 12Â½ feet square, with a bedroom
in the rear, of the same dimensions. The E. end is a
large store 25 Ã 20 feet, under which is an ice-house well
filled. The loft extends over the whole building, and contains
bales of goods, packs of peltries; also, chests with 500
bushels of wild rice. Beside the ice-house, there are cellars
under all the other parts of the building. The doors and
window-shutters are musket-proof.</p>

<p>On the W. side is a range of buildings 54 Ã 18 feet, fronting
the parade, the N. end of which is a cooper's shop 18 Ã 14
feet, with a cellar; joining to which is a room called the
Indian hall, expressly for the reception of Indians, and in
which the chiefs who met me in council were entertained.
In this hall are two closed bunks for interpreters; its
dimensions are 22 Ã 18 feet. Adjoining this is a room 18
feet square for the clerks, in which my small party were
quartered. Under both of the latter rooms are cellars.</p>

<p>On the E. side is a range of buildings 50 Ã 18 feet, which
has one room of 20 feet and one of 15 feet, for quarters for
the men; also, a blacksmith's shop of 15 feet, which is
occupied by an excellent workman. On the left of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
main gate, fronting the river, is the flag-staff, 50 feet in
height.</p>

<p>They intended building a small blockhouse over the main
gate, fronting the lake, to place a small piece of artillery in.
There are likewise gates on the N. and E. flanks, of about
10 Ã 8 feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">GEOGRAPHY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.<a name="FNanchor_VII-1" id="FNanchor_VII-1" href="#Footnote_VII-1" class="fnanchor">[VII-1]</a></span></h2>

<p class="hanging">
<i>Observations on the Soil, Shores, Quarries, Timber, Islands,
Rapids, Confluent Streams, Highlands, Prairies, and Settlements
on the Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_VII-2" id="FNanchor_VII-2" href="#Footnote_VII-2" class="fnanchor">[VII-2]</a> from St. Louis to its Source.</i></p>

<p>From St. Louis to the mouth of the Missouri, on the east
is a rich sandy soil, timbered with buttonwood, ash,
cottonwood, hackberry, etc. The west side is highlands for
a short distance above the town; then it is bordered by a
small prairie, after which is bottom-land, with the same
timber as on the east. The current is rapid, and the navigation
in low water obstructed by sand-bars.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately on the peninsula formed by the confluence
of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers is a small Kickapoo
settlement, occupied in summer only. On the west shore is
a rich prairie, with small skirts of woods; and on the east
shore is generally high hills, from 80 to 100 feet, extending
to the mouth of the Illinois. The current of the Mississippi,
above the entrance of the Missouri, is quite mild until you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
arrive at the mouth of the Illinois; where, owing to the
large sand-bars and many islands, it is extremely rapid.</p>

<p>The Illinois River is about 450 yards wide at its mouth,
and bears from the Mississippi N. 75Â° W. The current
appears not to exceed 2Â½ miles per hour. The navigation
and connecting streams of this river are too well known to
require a description at the present day. From the Illinois
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
to Buffalo river the E. shore is hills, but of easy ascent.
On the W. is continued the prairie, but not always bordering
on the river. The timber on both sides is generally
hackberry, cottonwood, and ash. Buffalo [Cuivre] river
comes in on the W. shore, and appears to be about 100
yards wide at its mouth; it bears from the Mississippi S. 30Â°
W. From the Illinois to this river the navigation is by no
means difficult, and the current mild.</p>

<p>Thence to Salt or Oahahah river, the east shore is either
immediately bounded by beautiful cedar cliffs, or the ridges
may be seen at a distance. On the W. shore there is a rich
low soil, and two small rivers which increase the waters of
the Mississippi. The first [Buffalo creek] called Bar river,
about 20 yards in width. The second [now Noir<a name="FNanchor_VII-3" id="FNanchor_VII-3" href="#Footnote_VII-3" class="fnanchor">[VII-3]</a> or Bear
creek] is about 15 yards. Salt river bears from the Mississippi
N. 75Â° W., and is about 100 or 120 yards wide at its entrance,
and when I passed appeared to be perfectly mild,
with scarcely any current. About one day's sail up the
river there are salt springs, which have been worked for four
years; but I am not informed as to their qualities or productions.
In this distance the navigation of the Mississippi
is very much obstructed by bars and islands; indeed to such
a degree as to render it in many places difficult to find the
proper channel. The shores are generally a sandy soil, timbered
with sugar-maple, ash, pecan, locust, and black walnut.
The E. side has generally the preference as to situations
for buildings.</p>

<p>From this to the river Jaustioni [Jauflione, Jeffrion, or
North Two Rivers: see <a href="#Footnote_I-14">note<sup>14</sup></a>, pp. 10, 11], which is our
boundary between the Sac nation and the United States on
the west side of the Mississippi, we have hills on the W.
shore, and lowlands on the E., the latter of which is timbered
with hickory, oak, ash, maple, pecan, etc.; the former
the same, with an increase of oak. The E. is a rich sandy soil,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
and has many very eligible situations for cultivation. About
seven miles below the Jaustioni a Frenchman is settled
on the W. shore. He is married to a woman of the Sac
nation, and lives by a little cultivation and the Indian trade.
The [North] river before mentioned is about 30 yards wide
at its mouth, and bears from the Mississippi about S. W.
In this part of the river the navigation is good.</p>

<p>From this to the Wyaconda river [at La Grange, Lewis
Co., Mo.] the navigation is easy, with very few impediments;
and the soil on both sides pretty good. This river pays its
tribute to the Mississippi by a mouth 100 yards wide, and
bears from the latter nearly due W. Just below its entrance
is [Durgan's creek] a small stream 15 yards wide, which discharges
into the Mississippi. Between this river and the
River de Moyen [Des Moines] there is one small [Fox]
river emptying into the Mississippi on the W., about 55
yards in width, and bearing S. by W. The first part of the
distance is obstructed by islands, and the river expands to a
great width, so as to render the navigation extremely difficult;
but the latter part affords more water and is less
difficult. The timber is principally oak and pecan; the soil
as on the river below. For a description of de Moyen,
see the chart herewith; and for that of the rapids [near
Keokuk] see my diary of <a href="#Page_14">Aug. 20th</a>.</p>

<p>Above the rapid de Moyen, on the W. bank of the Mississippi
[at Montrose, Lee Co., Ia.], is situated the first Sac
village, consisting of 13 lodges; and immediately opposite
is the establishment of Mr. Ewing,<a name="FNanchor_VII-4" id="FNanchor_VII-4" href="#Footnote_VII-4" class="fnanchor">[VII-4]</a> the American agent at
that place. Whence to a large prairie on the E. side, on
which [and on Henderson river] is situated the second Sac
village; the E. side of the river is beautiful land, principally
prairie. The W. is in some part highland; both sides are
timbered with oak, ash, etc. The navigation is by no means
difficult.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>Thence to the Iowa river the navigation is much obstructed
with islands. In ascending Iowa river 36 miles
you come to a fork, the right branch of which is called Red
Cedar river, from the quantity of that wood on its banks;
this is navigable for batteaux nearly 300 miles, where it
branches out into three forks, called the Turkey's foot.
Those forks shortly after lose themselves in Rice lakes.</p>

<p>The Iowa river bears from the Mississippi S. W. and is
150 yards wide at its mouth. The E. shore of the Mississippi
is high prairie, with yellow clay banks, and in some
places red sand. On the W. is prairie also, but bounded on
the shore by skirts of woods. About 10 miles up the Iowa
river, on its right bank, is a village of the Iowas.</p>

<p>From this place to Rock river we generally had beautiful
prairies on the W., but in some places very rich land, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
black walnut and hickory timber. Stony [Rock] river is
a large river which takes its source near Green bay of
Lake Michigan more than 450 miles from its mouth, and is
navigable upward of 300 miles; it empties into the Mississippi
on the E. shore, and is about 300 yards wide at its
mouth. It bears from the Mississippi almost due E.
About three miles up this river, on the S. bank [Milan,
Rock Island Co., Ill.], is situated the third town of the Sac
nation, which, I was informed by Mr. James Aird, was
burned in the year 1781 or 1782, by about 300 Americans,
although the Indians had assembled 700 warriors to give
them battle. For a description of the rapids of Stony
river, see my diary of <a href="#Page_25">Aug. 28th</a>.</p>

<p>Between Iowa river and Turkey river, on the W., you
find Wabisipinekan river. It coasts along Red Cedar river
in a parallel direction, with scarcely any wood on its banks.
The next water is the Great Macoketh, and 20 leagues higher
is the little river of the same name. These two rivers
appear to approach each other, and have nothing remarkable
excepting lead mines, which are said to be in their banks.</p>

<p>A little above the rapids of Rock river, on the W. side of
the Mississippi, is situated the first Reynard village; it consists
of about 18 lodges [Le Claire, Scott Co., Ia.]. From
this place to the lead mines [Dubuque, Ia.] the Mississippi
evidently becomes narrower; but the navigation is thereby
rendered much less difficult. The shores are generally
prairie, which, if not immediately bordering on the river,
can be seen through the skirts of forests which border the
river. The timber is generally maple, birch, and oak, and
the soil very excellent. To this place we had seen only
a few turkeys and deer, the latter of which are pretty
numerous from the river de Moyen up. For a description
of the lead mines, see my report from the prairie des Chiens
of Sept. 5th.<a name="FNanchor_VII-5" id="FNanchor_VII-5" href="#Footnote_VII-5" class="fnanchor">[VII-5]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<p>From the lead mines unto Turkey river the Mississippi
continues about the same width; and the banks, soil, and
productions are entirely similar. Turkey river empties on
the W., bears from the Mississippi about S. W., and is
about 100 yards wide at its mouth. Half a league up this
river, on the right bank, is the third village of the Reynards,
at which place they raise sufficient corn to supply all the
permanent and transient inhabitants of the Prairie des
Chiens. Thence to the Ouiscousing the high hills are perceptible
on both sides, but on the W. almost border the
river the whole distance. The Ouiscousing at its entrance
is nearly half a mile wide, and bears from the Mississippi
nearly N. E.</p>

<p>This river is the grand source of communication between
the lakes and the Mississippi, and the route by which all the
traders of Michilimackinac convey their goods for the trade
of the Mississippi from St. Louis to the river de Corbeau,
and the confluent streams which are in those boundaries.</p>

<p class="p2">The voyage from Michilimackinac to the Prairie des
Chiens, by the Ouiscousing and Fox rivers, is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_VII-6" id="FNanchor_VII-6" href="#Footnote_VII-6" class="fnanchor">[VII-6]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"The distance between Michilimackinac and the settlement
at the bottom of Green bay is calculated to be 80
leagues. On leaving Michilimackinac there is a traverse of
five miles to Point St. Ignace [in Mackinac Co., Mich.], which
is the entrance into Lake Michigan. Four leagues from
Michilimackinac is an island of considerable extent, named
St. Helens [or Helena], which may be seen from that place
on a clear day. The shore [of Lake Michigan] from Michilimackinac
to Point du Chene [Pointe au ChÃªne, Oak Point],
which is a league distant from the island, is rocky; and from
this point to the island of Epouvette, which is a very small
one near the banks of the lake, is high and covered with
pine; the soil is very barren. From this island to the river
Mino Cockien [Milakokia] is five leagues. Two small
islands are on the way, and a river where boats and canoes
may take shelter from a storm. The river Mino Cockien is
large and deep, and takes its rise near Lake Superior.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
From this to Shouchoir [Pointe Seul Choix, in Schoolcraft
Co., Mich.] is ten leagues. The shore [along by Points
Patterson, Scott, and Hughes] is dangerous, from the
number of shoals that extend a great way into the lake.
This rock [or point], called Shouchoir, is an excellent
harbor for canoes, but its entrance, when the wind blows
from the lake, is difficult; but when once in, canoes and
boats may lie during any storm without unlading. A custom
prevails here among the voyagers for everyone to
have his name carved on the rocks the first time he passes,
and pay something to the canoe-men. From this to the
river Manistique [Monistique, at Epsport, Schoolcraft Co.,
Mich.] is five leagues. This is a large river; the entrance
is difficult, from a sand-bank at its mouth, and the waves
are very high when the wind blows from the lake. At certain
seasons sturgeon are found here in great numbers. The
banks of this river are high and sandy, covered with pine.
It takes its rise [in part] from a large lake [of the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
name], and nearly communicates with Lake Superior.
From this to the Detour [Pointe de Tour (Turning Point),
end of the peninsula in Delta Co., between Baie de Noc
and Lake Michigan] is 10 leagues [passing Point Wiggins,
Pointe au Barque, and Portage bay]. The shore is rocky,
flat, and dangerous. Here begins the Traverse, at the
mouth of Green bay. The first island is distant from the
mainland about a league, and is called the Isle au Detour
[now Big Summer island]; it is at least three leagues in
circumference. There are generally a few Sauteaux lodges
of Indians on this island during the summer months.
From this to Isle Brule [Gravelly island] is three leagues.
There are two small [Gull] islands from these to Isle Verte
[St. Martin's island], and it is two leagues to Isle de Pou
[Washington island], called so from the Poutowatomies
having once had a village here, now abandoned. In the
months of May and June there is a fishery of trout [<i>Salmo
(Cristivomer) namaycush</i>], and they are taken in great
quantities by trolling. There are also whitefish [<i>Coregonus
clupeiformis</i>] in vast numbers. The ship channel is between
this island and Isle Verte. Thence to Petit D'Etroit
[DÃ©troit] to the mainland is three leagues, where some
lodges of Ottawas and Sauteaux raise small quantities of
corn; but their subsistence, during the summer months,
chiefly depends upon the quantities of sturgeon [<i>Acipenser
rubicundus</i>] and other fish, with which the lake here
abounds. From Petit D'Etroit [the strait between Washington
island and the mainland of Door Co., Wis., in which
are Detroit, Plum, and Pilot islands] to the mainland is
three leagues, and is called the Port de Mort [Porte des
Morts], from a number of Reynard canoes having been
wrecked at this place, where everyone perished. The shore
is bold and rocky [Hedgehog Harbor, Death's Door Bluffs,
Sister Bluffs, etc.]. From this it is four leagues to the Isle
Racro [Horseshoe island, in Eagle bay], which is a safe
harbor, inaccessible to all winds. From this to Sturgeon
bay is eight leagues. The shore is bold and rocky [Eagle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Bluff, Egg Harbor, etc.], and several large [Chambers,
Green, and the small Strawberry, and Hat] islands lie a few
miles distant. A few Sauteaux families raise corn here and
reside during the summer season. Trout and sturgeon are
here in great numbers. Sturgeon's bay is two miles across
and about four leagues in length, and communicates by a
portage [now a canal] with Lake Michigan, near Michilimackinac.
Distant from the lake about two leagues is the
Isle Vermillion [off Little Sturgeon bay]. Here were a few
years ago a number of Fols Avoin inhabitants, who were
accustomed to raise corn; but for what reasons they have
left this place I cannot learn. From this is 13 leagues to
the entrance of Fox river. On leaving Isle Vermillion,
the woods and general appearance of the country begin to
change, and have a very different aspect from the more
northern parts of this lake [<i>i. e.</i>, Green bay]. A small river
called Riviere Rouge [Red river, and town of same name,
in Kewaunee Co.] falls into the lake [Green bay], about
halfway between Isle Vermillion and La Baye [La Baie;<a name="FNanchor_VII-7" id="FNanchor_VII-7" href="#Footnote_VII-7" class="fnanchor">[VII-7]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
location of Green Bay, seat of Brown Co.]. On approaching
La Baye, the water of the latter [lake, <i>i. e.</i>, Green bay]
assumes a whiter appearance, and becomes less deep. A
channel which winds a good deal may be found for vessels
of 50 and 60 tons burden; loaded vessels of these dimensions
have gone up Fox river to the French settlement [of
La Baie, site of Depere], opposite which is the Fols Avoin
village [present site of Nicollet], which consists of 10 or 12
bark lodges. A great number of Sauteaux, and some
Ottawas, come here in the spring and fall. Three leagues
from La Baye [present Green Bay] is a small village [below
present Little Kaukauna] of the same nation; and there is
another three leagues higher, at the portage of Kakalin
[Little Rapids<a name="FNanchor_VII-8" id="FNanchor_VII-8" href="#Footnote_VII-8" class="fnanchor">[VII-8]</a>]. This portage is a mile long; the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
even and rocky. There is a fall of about ten feet, which obstructs
the navigation. For three leagues higher are almost
continual rapids, until the fall of Grand Konimee [vicinity
of present Kaukauna], about five feet high. Above this, the
river opens into a small lake, at the end of which is a strong
rapid, called Puant's rapid [now Winnebago rapids], which
issues from a lake of that name [<i>i. e.</i>, Lake Winnebago, in
Winnebago Co.<a name="FNanchor_VII-9" id="FNanchor_VII-9" href="#Footnote_VII-9" class="fnanchor">[VII-9]</a>]. This lake is 10 leagues long, and from
two to three wide. At its entrance [where are now
Menasha and Neenah, Winnebago Co.] is another Puant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
village, of about the same number of lodges, and at this
end is a small river, which, with the interval of a few
portages, communicates with Rock river [of Wisconsin and
Illinois]. About midway between the two Puant villages is
a Fols Avoin village, on the south [-east] side of the lake [in
Calumet Co.], of 50 or 60 men. Five leagues from the
entrance of the lake, on the north [-west] side, Fox river
falls in [at Oshkosh, Winnebago Co.], and is about 200
yards wide. Ascending two leagues higher, is a small Fols
Avoin village, where is a lake [Lac Butte des Morts] more
than two leagues long; and about a league above this lake
the river de Loup [Wolf river, after flowing through Poygan
lake] joins Fox river near a hill [and town] called the But
de Mort [Butte des Morts], where the Fox nation were
nearly exterminated by the French and Confederate Indians.
The rivers and lakes are, at certain seasons, full of wild rice.
The country on the borders of this [Fox] river is finely
diversified with woods and prairies. Any quantity of hay
may be made, and it is as fine a country for raising stock as
any in the same latitude through all America. From the
But de Mort to the Lac a Puckway<a name="FNanchor_VII-10" id="FNanchor_VII-10" href="#Footnote_VII-10" class="fnanchor">[VII-10]</a> is 28 leagues. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
is another Puant village, of seven or eight large lodges.
This lake is three leagues long; four leagues above it Lac
de B&oelig;uf [Buffalo lake] begins, which is also four leagues
long; this is full of wild rice, and has a great many fowl in
their season. From Lac de B&oelig;uf to the forks [confluence
of the Necha river with Fox river], which is five leagues
from the portage of the Ouiscousing, and 10 leagues above
the forks [??], is a very small lake, called Lac Vaseux
[Muddy lake], so choked with wild rice as to render it
almost impassable. The [Fox] river, although very winding,
becomes more and more serpentine on approaching the
portage, and narrows so much as almost to prevent the use of
oars. The length of the portage to the Ouiscousing [river,
at present town of Portage, Columbia Co.] is two miles;
but when the waters are high, canoes and boats pass over
loaded. Here the waters at that time separate, one part
going to the Gulf of Mexico, and the other to that of St.
Lawrence. In wet seasons the portage road is very bad,
the soil being of a swampy nature. There is for nearly halfway
a kind of natural canal, which is sometimes used, and
I think a canal between the two rivers might be easily cut
[Wis. Cent., and C., M., and St. P. R. R. to Portage now].
The expense at present attending the transport is one-third
of a dollar per cwt.; for a canoe $5 and a boat $8; this is
not cash, but in goods at the rate of 200 per cent. on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
sterling. There are at present two white men who have
establishments there; they are much incommoded by the
Puants of Rock river, who are troublesome visitors. The
Ouiscousing is a large river; its bottom sandy, full of
islands and sand-bars during the summer season. The navigation
is difficult even for canoes, owing to the lowness of
the water. From the portage to its confluence with the
Mississippi is 60 leagues [about 40 leagues&mdash;112 miles].
The Saques and Reynards formerly lived on its banks,
but were driven off by the Sauteaux. They were accustomed
to raise a great deal of corn and beans, the soil
being excellent. Opposite the Detour de Pin, halfway
from the portage, on the south side, are lead mines, said to
be the best in any part of the country, and to be wrought
with great ease. Boats of more than four tons are improper
for the communication between the Mississippi and
Michilimackinac." (<i>[Colonel Robert] Dickson.</i>)</p>
</div>

<p>The present village of Prairie des Chiens was first settled
in the year 1783, and the first settlers were Mr. Giard, Mr.
Antaya, and Mr. Dubuque. The old village is about a
mile below the present one, and existed during the time
the French were possessed of the country. It derives its
name from a family of Reynards who formerly lived there,
distinguished by the appellation of Dogs. The present
village was settled under the English government, and the
ground was purchased from the Reynard Indians. It is
situated about one league above the mouth of the Ouiscousing
river. On the E. bank of the river there is a small
pond or marsh which runs parallel to the river in the rear of
the town, which, in front of the marsh, consists of 18 dwelling-houses,
in two streets; 16 in Front Street and two in
First Street. In the rear of the pond are eight dwelling-houses;
part of the houses are framed, and in place of
weatherboarding there are small logs let into mortises made
in the uprights, joined close, daubed on the outside with
clay, and handsomely whitewashed within. The inside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
furniture of their houses is decent and, indeed, in those of
the most wealthy displays a degree of elegance and taste.</p>

<p>There are eight houses scattered round the country, at
the distance of one, two, three, and five miles: also, on the
W. side of the Mississippi [now Bloody Run, on which is
N. McGregor, Clayton Co., Ia.] three houses, situated on a
small stream called Giards [or Giard's] river, making, in the
village and vicinity, 37 houses, which it will not be too
much to calculate at 10 persons each. The population
would thus be 370 souls; but this calculation will not answer
for the spring or autumn, as there are then, at least, 500 or
600 white persons. This is owing to the concourse of traders
and their engagees from Michilimackinac and other parts,
who make this their last stage previous to launching into
the savage wilderness. They again meet here in the spring,
on their return from their wintering-grounds, accompanied by
300 or 400 Indians, when they hold a fair; the one disposes
of remnants of goods, and the others reserved peltries. It is
astonishing that there are not more murders and affrays at
this place, where meets such an heterogeneous mass to trade,
the use of spirituous liquors being in no manner restricted;
but since the American has become known, such accidents
are much less frequent than formerly. The prairie on which
the village is situated is bounded in the rear by high bald
hills. It is from one mile to three-quarters of a mile from
the river, and extends about eight miles from the Mississippi,
to where it strikes the Ouiscousing at the Petit Grey,
which bears from the village S. E. by E.</p>

<p>If the marsh before spoken of were drained, which might
be easily done, I am of the opinion it would render healthy
the situation of the prairie, which now subjects its inhabitants
to intermitting fevers in the spring and autumn.</p>

<p>There are a few gentlemen residing at the Prairie des
Chiens, and many others claiming that appellation; but the
rivalship of the Indian trade occasions them to be guilty of
acts at their wintering-grounds which they would blush to
be thought guilty of in the civilized world. They possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
the spirit of generosity and hospitality in an eminent degree,
but this is the leading feature in the character of frontier
inhabitants. Their mode of living has obliged them to have
transient connection with the Indian women; and what was
at first policy is now so confirmed by habit and inclination
that it is become the ruling practice of the traders, with
few exceptions; in fact, almost one-half the inhabitants
under 20 years have the blood of the aborigines in their
veins.</p>

<p>From this village to Lake Pepin we have, on the W. shore
[Iowa and Minnesota], first Yellow river [present name; at
its mouth Council Hill, Allamakee Co., Ia.], of about 20
yards wide, bearing from the Mississippi nearly due W.;
second, the [Upper] Iowa river, about 100 yards wide, bearing
from the Mississippi about N. W.; third, the Racine
[Root] river, about 20 yards wide, bearing from the Mississippi
nearly W., and navigable for canoes 60 miles; fourth,
the rivers Embarra [Embarras, or Zumbro] and Lean Claire
[l'Eau Claire, now White Water or Minneiska], which join
their waters just as they form a confluence with the Mississippi,
are about 60 yards wide, and bear nearly S. W.</p>

<p>On the E. shore [Wisconsin], in the same distance, is the
river de la Prairie la Cross [La Crosse river], which empties
into the Mississippi at the head of the prairie of that name.
It is about 20 yards wide, and bears N. N. W. We then
meet with the Black [present name] river, a very considerable
stream about 200 yards wide at its mouth, on which the
traders frequently winter with the Puants and Fols Avoins.
Next we pass the river of the Montaigne qui Trompes dans
l'Eau [RiviÃ¨re de la Montagne qui Trempe Ã  l'Eau, now
Trempealeau river], a small stream in the rear of the hill of
that name. Then we find the Riviere au B&oelig;uf [Buffalo river],
about 30 yards wide, bearing N. by W. At the entrance of
Lake Pepin, on the E. shore, joins the Sauteaux [Chippewa]
river, which is at least half a mile wide, and appears to be a
deep and majestic stream. It bears from the Mississippi
nearly due N. This river is in size and course, for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
distance up, scarcely to be distinguished from the Ouiscousing;
it has a communication with Montreal river by a
short portage, and by this river with Lake Superior.<a name="FNanchor_VII-11" id="FNanchor_VII-11" href="#Footnote_VII-11" class="fnanchor">[VII-11]</a> The
agents of the N. W. Company supply the Fols Avoin Sauteaux
who reside at the head of this river; and those of
Michilimackinac, the Sioux who hunt on its lower waters.</p>

<p>In this division of the Mississippi the shores are more
than three-fourths prairie on both sides, or, more properly
speaking, bald hills which, instead of running parallel with
the river, form a continual succession of high perpendicular
cliffs and low valleys; they appear to head on the river, and
to traverse the country in an angular direction. Those
hills and valleys give rise to some of the most sublime and
romantic views I ever saw. But this irregular scenery is
sometimes interrupted by a wide extended plain which
brings to mind the verdant lawn of civilized life, and would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
almost induce the traveler to imagine himself in the center
of a highly cultivated plantation. The timber of this division
is generally birch, elm, and Cottonwood; all the cliffs
being bordered by cedar.</p>

<p>The navigation unto [Upper] Iowa river is good, but
thence to the Sauteaux river is very much obstructed by
islands; in some places the Mississippi is uncommonly wide,
and divided into many small channels which from the cliffs
appear like so many distinct rivers, winding in a parallel
course through the same immense valley. But there are
few sand-bars in those narrow channels; the soil being rich,
the water cuts through it with facility.</p>

<p>La Montaigne qui Trompe dans l'Eau stands in the Mississippi
near the E. shore, about 50 miles below the Sauteaux
river, and is about two miles in circumference, with an elevation
of 200 feet, covered with timber. There is a small
[Trempealeau: see <a href="#Footnote_I-56">note<sup>56</sup></a>, pp. 52-54] river which empties
into the Mississippi in the rear of the mountain, which I
conceive once bounded the mountain on the lower side, and
the Mississippi on the upper, when the mountain was
joined to the main by a neck of low prairie ground, which
in time was worn away by the spring freshets of the
Mississippi, and thus formed an island of this celebrated
mountain.</p>

<p>Lake Pepin, so called by the French, appears to be only
an expansion of the Mississippi. It commences at the entrance
of the Sauteaux, and bears N. 55Â° W. 12 miles to Point
de Sable, which is a neck of land making out about one
mile into the lake from the W. shore, and is the narrowest
part of the lake. From here to the upper end the course is
nearly due W. about 10 miles, making its whole length 22
miles, and from 4 to 1Â½ miles in width; the broadest part
being in the bay below Point de Sable. This is a beautiful
place; the contrast of the Mississippi full of islands, and the
lake with not one in its whole extent, gives more force to
the grandeur of the scene. The French, under the government
of M. Frontenac, drove the Reynards or Ottaquamies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
[Outagamas, etc.] from the Ouiscousing, pursued them up
the Mississippi, and, as a barrier, built a stockade [Fort
Beauharnois?] on Lake Pepin on the W. shore, just below
Point de Sable. As was generally the case with that nation,
they blended the military and mercantile professions, by
making their fort a factory for the Sioux. The lake, at the
upper end, is three fathoms deep; but this, I am informed,
is its shoalest part. From [Upper] Iowa river to the head
of Lake Pepin, elk are the prevailing species of wild game,
with some deer, and a few bear.</p>

<p>From the head of Lake Pepin for about 12 miles, to
Cannon river, the Mississippi is branched out into many
channels, and its bosom covered with numerous islands.
There is a hill on the W. shore [at Red Wing], about six
miles above the lake, called the Grange [la Grange, the Barn],
from the summit of which you have one of the most delightful
prospects in nature. When turning your face to the E.
you have the river winding in three [South, Middle, and
North] channels at your feet; on your right the extensive
bosom of the lake, bounded by its chain of hills; in front,
over the Mississippi, a wide extended prairie; on the left
the valley of the Mississippi, open to view quite to the St.
Croix; and partly in your rear, the valley through which
passes Riviere au Canon. When I viewed it, on one of the
islands below appeared the spotted lodges of Red Wing's
band of Sioux. The white tents of the traders and my
soldiers, and three flags of the United States waving on the
water, gave a contrast to the still and lifeless wilderness
around and increased the pleasure of the prospect.</p>

<p>From Cannon river to the St. Croix, the Mississippi evidently
becomes narrower, and the navigation less obstructed
by islands. St. Croix river joins the Mississippi on the E.,
and bears from the latter almost due N. It is only 80 yards
wide at its mouth, but 500 yards up commences [Lower]
Lake St. Croix, which is from 1Â½ to 3 miles wide, and 36
long. This river communicates with Lake Superior by the
Burnt river, by a portage of half a mile only, and in its whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
extent has not one fall or rapid worthy of notice.<a name="FNanchor_VII-12" id="FNanchor_VII-12" href="#Footnote_VII-12" class="fnanchor">[VII-12]</a> This,
with the mildness of its current, and its other advantages,
render it by far the most preferable communication which
can be had with the N. W. from this part of our territories.
Its upper waters are inhabited by the Fols Avoins and Sauteaux,
who are supplied by the agents of the North West
Company; and its lower division, by the Sioux and their
traders.</p>

<p>The Mississippi from Cannon river is bounded on the E.
by high ridges, but the left is low ground. The timber is
generally ash and maple, except the cedar of the cliffs.
From the St. Croix to the St. Peters the Mississippi is collected
into a narrow compass; I crossed it at one place with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
40 strokes of my oars,<a name="FNanchor_VII-13" id="FNanchor_VII-13" href="#Footnote_VII-13" class="fnanchor">[VII-13]</a> and the navigation is very good.
The E. bank is generally bounded by the river ridges, but
the W. sometimes by timbered bottom or prairie. The
timber is generally maple, sugar-tree, and ash. About 20
miles below the entrance of the St. Peters, on the E. shore,
at a place called the Grand Morais [Marais, Big Marsh, now
Pig's Eye marsh or lake], is situated Petit Corbeau's village
of 11 log houses. For a description of the St. Peters see
the chart herewith.</p>

<p>From the St. Peters to the Falls of St. Anthony the
river is contracted between high hills, and is one continual
rapid or fall, the bottom being covered with rocks which in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
low water are some feet above the surface, leaving narrow
channels between them. The rapidity of the current is
likewise much augmented by the numerous small, rocky
islands which obstruct the navigation. The shores have
many large and beautiful springs issuing forth, which form
small cascades as they tumble over the cliffs into the Mississippi.
The timber is generally maple. This place we noted
for the great quantity of wild fowl.</p>

<p>As I ascended the Mississippi, the Falls of St. Anthony
did not strike me with that majestic appearance which I had
been taught to expect from the descriptions of former travelers.
On an actual survey I find the portage to be 260
poles; but when the river is not very low, boats ascending
may be put in 31 poles below, at a large cedar tree; this
would reduce it to 229 poles. The hill over which the portage
is made is 69 feet in ascent, with an elevation at the
point of debarkation of 45Â°. The fall of the water between
the place of debarkation and reloading is 58 feet; the perpendicular
fall of the shoot is 16Â½ feet. The width of the
river above the shoot is 627 yards; below, 209. For the
form of the shoot, see a rough draught herewith.<a name="FNanchor_VII-14" id="FNanchor_VII-14" href="#Footnote_VII-14" class="fnanchor">[VII-14]</a> In high
water the appearance is much more sublime, as the great
quantity of water then forms a spray, which in clear weather
reflects from some positions the colors of the rainbow, and
when the sky is overcast covers the falls in gloom and
chaotic majesty.</p>

<p>From the Falls of St. Anthony to Rum river, the Mississippi
is almost one continual chain of rapids, with the eddies
formed by winding channels. Both sides are prairie, with
scarcely any timber but small groves of scrub oak. Rum
river is about 50 yards wide at its mouth, and takes its
source in Le Mille Lac,<a name="FNanchor_VII-15" id="FNanchor_VII-15" href="#Footnote_VII-15" class="fnanchor">[VII-15]</a> which is but 35 miles S. of Lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Red Cedar Lake. The small Indian canoes ascend this
river quite to the lake, which is considered as one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
best fur hunting-grounds for some hundreds of miles, and
has been long a scene of rencounters between the hunting-parties
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
of the Sioux and Sauteaux. Last winter a number
of Fols Avoins and Sioux, and some Sauteaux wintered in
that quarter. From Rum river to Leaf river, called [not] by
Father Hennipin and [but by] Carver the river St. Francis,<a name="FNanchor_VII-16" id="FNanchor_VII-16" href="#Footnote_VII-16" class="fnanchor">[VII-16]</a>
and which was the extent of their travels, the prairies continue
with few interruptions. The timber is scrub-oak, with
now and then a lonely pine. Previous to your arrival at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Leaf river, you pass Crow [Carver's Goose] river on the W.,
about 30 yards wide, which bears from the Mississippi S. W.
Leaf river is only a small stream of not more than 15 yards
over, and bears N. by W.</p>

<p>The elk begin to be very plenty; there are also some
buffalo, quantities of deer, raccoons, and on the prairie a
few of the animals called by the French brelaws [blaireaux,
badgers].</p>

<p>Thence to Sac [or Sauk] river, a little above the Grand
Rapids [Sauk Rapids, St. Cloud, etc.], both sides of the river
are generally prairie, with skirts of scrub-oak. The navigation
is still obstructed with ripples, but with some intermissions
of a few miles.</p>

<p>At the Grand Rapids the river expands to about Â¾ of a
mile in width, its general width not being more than &#8535; of a
mile, and tumbles over an unequal bed of rocks for about
two miles, through which there cannot be said to be any
channel; for, notwithstanding the rapidity of the current,
one of my invalids who was on the W. shore waded to the
E., where we were encamped. The E. bank of these rapids
is a very high prairie; the W. scrubby wood-land. The Sac
river is a considerable stream, which comes in on the W.
and bears about S. W., and is 200 yards wide at its mouth.</p>

<p>The quantity of game increases from Sac river to Pine
creek [now Swan river], the place where I built my stockade
and left part of my party; the borders are prairie, with
groves of pine on the edge of the bank; but there are some
exceptions, where you meet with small bottoms of oak, ash,
maple, and lynn [linden, basswood or whitewood, <i>Tilia
americana</i>&mdash;bois blanc of the voyageurs].</p>

<p>In this distance there is an intermission of rapids for
about 40 miles, when they commence again, and are fully as
difficult as ever. There are three small creeks<a name="FNanchor_VII-17" id="FNanchor_VII-17" href="#Footnote_VII-17" class="fnanchor">[VII-17]</a> emptying
on the W. scarcely worthy of notice, and on the E. are two
small rivers called Lake and Clear Rivers; the former, quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
a small one [now called Little Rock], bears N. W., and is
about 15 yards wide at its mouth; about three miles from
its entrance is a beautiful small [Little Rock] lake, around
which resort immense herds of elk and buffalo. Clear river
[now called Platte river] is a beautiful little stream of about
80 yards in width, which heads in some swamps and small
lakes [Platte, Ogechie, etc.] on which the Sauteaux of Lower
Red Cedar Lake and Sandy Lake frequently come to hunt.
The soil of the prairies from above the falls is sandy, but
would raise small grain in abundance; the bottoms are rich,
and fit for corn or hemp.</p>

<p>Pine creek [now Swan river] is a small stream which
comes in on the W. shore, and bears nearly W. It is bordered
by large groves of white and red pine.</p>

<p>From Pine creek to the Isle De Corbeau, or river of that
name [now called Crow Wing], two small rivers come in on
the W. shore. The first [now Pike creek] is of little consequence;
but the second, called Elk [or as now Little Elk]
river, is entitled to more consideration, from its communication
with the river St. Peters. They first ascend it to a
small lake, cross this, then ascend a small stream [Long
Prairie river, a branch of Crow Wing river] to a large [Osakis]
lake; from which they make a portage of four miles W.
and fall into the Sauteaux [or Chippewa<a name="FNanchor_VII-18" id="FNanchor_VII-18" href="#Footnote_VII-18" class="fnanchor">[VII-18]</a>] river, which they
descend into the river St. Peters. On the E. side is one
small stream [Nokasippi river], which heads toward Lower
Red Cedar Lake, and is bounded by hills.</p>

<p>The whole of this distance is remarkably difficult to navigate,
being one continued succession of rapid shoals and
falls; but there is one [fall which] deserves to be more particularly
noticed, viz.: The place called by the French Le
Shute de la Roche Peinture [La Chute de la Roche Peinte,
Rapids of the Painted Rock, now Little falls], which is certainly
the third obstacle in point of navigation which I met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
with in my whole route. The shore, where there is not prairie,
is a continued succession of pine ridges. The entrance
of the river De Corbeau is partly hid by the island of that
name, and discharges its waters into the Mississippi above
and below it; the lowest channel bearing from the Mississippi
N. 65Â° W., the upper due W. This, in my opinion, should
be termed the Forks of the Mississippi, it being nearly of
equal magnitude, and heading not far from the same source,
although taking a much more direct course to their junction.
It may be observed on the chart that, from St. Louis to this
place, the course of the river has generally been N. to W.
and that from here it bears N. E.</p>

<p>This river affords the best and most approved communication
with the Red river; and the navigation is as follows:
You ascend the river De Corbeau 180 miles, to the
entrance of the river Des Feuilles [now Leaf river], which
comes from the N. W. This you ascend 180 miles also;
then make a portage of half a mile into Otter Tail Lake,<a name="FNanchor_VII-19" id="FNanchor_VII-19" href="#Footnote_VII-19" class="fnanchor">[VII-19]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
which is a principal source of Red river. The other [Long
Prairie] branch of the river De Corbeau bears S. W. and approximates
with the St. Peters. The whole of this river is
rapid, and by no means affording so much water as the Mississippi.
Their confluence is in latitude 45Â° 49Â´ 50Â´Â´ N. In
this division the elk, deer, and buffalo were probably in
greater quantities than in any other part of my whole voyage.</p>

<p>Thence to Pine river [present name: not to be confounded
with Pike's Pine creek, now Swan river] the Mississippi
continues to become narrower, and has but few
islands. In this distance I discovered but one rapid, which
the force of the frost had not entirely covered with ice. The
shores in general presented a dreary prospect of high barren
nobs, covered with dead and fallen pine timber. To this
there were some exceptions of ridges of yellow and pitch-pine;
also some small bottoms of lynn, elm, oak, and ash.
The adjacent country is at least two-thirds covered with
small lakes, some of which are three miles in circumference.
This renders communication impossible in summer, except
with small bark canoes.</p>

<p>In this distance we first met with a species of pine [fir]
called the sap pine [French sapin, balsam-fir, <i>Abies balsamea</i>].
It was equally unknown to myself and all my
party. It scarcely ever exceeds the height of 35 feet, and is
very full of projecting branches. The leaves are similar to
other pines, but project out from the branches on each side
in a direct line, thereby rendering the branch flat. This
formation occasions the natives and voyagers to give it the
preference on all occasions to the branches of all other trees
for their beds, and to cover their temporary camps; but its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
greatest virtue arises from its medicinal qualities. The rind
is smooth, with the exception of little protuberances of
about the size of a hazel-nut; the top of which being cut,
you squeeze out a glutinous substance of the consistence of
honey. This gum or sap gives name to the tree, and is used
by the natives and traders of that country as a balsam for
all wounds made by sharp instruments, or for parts frozen,
and almost all other external injuries which they receive.
My poor fellows experienced its beneficial qualities by the
application made of it to their frozen extremities in various
instances.</p>

<p>Pine river bears from the Mississippi N. 30Â° E., although
it empties on that which has been hitherto termed the
W. shore. It is 80 yards wide at its mouth, and has an
island immediately at the entrance. It communicates with
Lake Le Sang Sue [Leech lake] by the following course of
navigation: In one day's sail from the confluence, you
arrive at the first part of White Fish Lake [present name],
which is about six miles long and two wide. Thence you
pursue the river about two miles, and come to the second
White Fish Lake, which is about three miles long and one
wide; then you have the river three miles to the third lake,
which is seven miles long and two in width. This I crossed
on my return from the head of the Mississippi on the [20th]
of February; it is in 46Â° 32Â´ 32Â´Â´ N. lat. Thence you follow
the river a quarter of a mile to the fourth lake, which is a circular
one of about five miles in circumference. Thence you
pursue the river one day's sail to a small lake; thence two
days' sail to a portage, which conveys you to another lake;
whence, by small portages from lake to lake, you make the
voyage to Leech Lake. The whole of this course lies
through ridges of pines or swamps of pinenet [Ã©pinette<a name="FNanchor_VII-20" id="FNanchor_VII-20" href="#Footnote_VII-20" class="fnanchor">[VII-20]</a>],
sap pine, hemlock, etc. From the river De Corbeau to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
place the deer are very plenty, but we found no buffalo
or elk.</p>

<p>From this spot to [Lower] Red Cedar Lake, the pine
ridges are interrupted by large bottoms of elm, ash, oak, and
maple, the soil of which would be very proper for cultivation.
From the appearance of the ice, which was firm and
equal, I conceive there can be but one ripple in this distance.
[Lower] Red Cedar lake lies on the E. side of the
Mississippi, at the distance of six miles from it, and is near
equally distant from the river De Corbeau and Lake De
Sable [Sandy lake]. Its form is an oblong square, and
may be 10 miles in circumference. From this to Lake De
Sable, on the E. shore, you meet with Muddy [now Rice]
river, which discharges itself into the Mississippi by a
mouth 20 yards wide, and bears nearly N. E. We then
meet with Pike [now Willow: see <a href="#Footnote_II-49">note<sup>49</sup></a>, p. 127] river, on
the W., about 77 [air-line about 15] miles below Sandy lake,
bearing nearly due N.; up which you ascend with canoes
four days' sail, and arrive at a Wild Rice lake, which you
pass through and enter a small stream, and ascend it two
leagues; then cross a portage of two acres into a [Big Rice]
lake seven leagues in circumference; then two leagues of a
[Kwiwisens or Little Boy] river into another small lake.
Thence you descend the current N. E. into Leech lake.
The banks of the Mississippi are still bordered by pines of
different species, except a few small bottoms of elm, lynn,
and maple. The game is scarce, and the aborigines subsist
almost entirely on the beaver, with a few moose, and
wild rice or oats.</p>

<p>Sandy Lake River, the discharge of said lake, is large, but
only six [about two] miles in length from the lake to its
confluence with the Mississippi. Lake De Sable is about
25 miles in circumference, and has a number of small rivers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
running into it. One of those is entitled to particular
attention: the Savanna, which by a portage of 3Â¾ miles
communicates with the river [Fond Du Lac or] St. Louis,
which empties into Lake Superior at Fond Du Lac, and is
the channel by which the N. W. Company bring all their
goods for the trade of the Upper Mississippi. Game is
very scarce in this country.</p>

<p>In ascending the Mississippi from Sandy Lake, you first
meet with the Swan river [still so called: not to be confounded
with the other of the same present name] on the
east, which bears nearly due E., and is navigable for bark
canoes for 90 miles to Swan Lake. You then meet with
the Meadow [or Prairie] River, which falls in on the E.,
bears nearly E. by N., and is navigable for Indian canoes
100 miles. You then in ascending meet with a very strong
ripple [Grand rapids], and an expansion of the river where
it forms a small lake. This is three miles below the Falls
of Packegamau [Pokegama], and from which the noise of
that shoot might be heard. The course of the river is N.
70Â° W.; just below, the river is a quarter of a mile in width,
but above the shoot not more than 20 yards. The water
thus collected runs down a flat rock, which has an elevation
of about 30 degrees. Immediately above the fall is a small
island of about 50 yards in circumference, covered with sap
pine. The portage, which is on the E. (or N.) side, is no
more than 200 yards, and by no means difficult. Those
falls, in point of consideration as an impediment to the
navigation, stand next to the Falls of St. Anthony, from
the source of the river to the Gulf of Mexico. The banks
of the river to Meadow river have generally either been
timbered by pine, pinenett [Ã©pinette], hemlock, sap pine
[sapin or balsam-fir], or aspen tree. Thence it winds
through high grass meadows or savannas, with pine swamps
appearing at a distance to cast a deeper gloom on the
borders. From the falls in ascending, you pass Lake Packegamau
on the W., celebrated for its great production of
wild rice; and next meet with Deer river [present name]
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
on the E., the extent of its navigation unknown. You
next meet with the Riviere Le Crosse<a name="FNanchor_VII-21" id="FNanchor_VII-21" href="#Footnote_VII-21" class="fnanchor">[VII-21]</a> [RiviÃ¨re Ã  la Crosse]
on the E. side, which bears nearly N., and has only a portage
of one mile to pass from it into the Lake Winipeque
Branch of the Mississippi [through Little Lake Winnibigoshish].</p>

<p>We next come to what the people of that quarter call
the forks of the Mississippi, the right fork of which bears
N. W., and runs eight leagues to Lake Winipeque [Winnibigoshish<a name="FNanchor_VII-22" id="FNanchor_VII-22" href="#Footnote_VII-22" class="fnanchor">[VII-22]</a>],
which is of an oval form, and about 36 miles in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
circumference. From Lake Winipeque the river continues
five leagues to Upper Red Cedar [now Cass] Lake, which
may be termed the Upper Source of the Mississippi. The
[other fork or] Leech Lake Branch bears from the forks S.
W., and runs through a chain of meadows. You pass Muddy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
[or Mud] lake, which is scarcely anything more than an extensive
marsh of 15 miles in circumference; the river bears
through it nearly N., after which it again turns W. In
many places this branch is not more than 10 or 15 yards
in width, although 15 or 20 feet deep. From this to Leech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
Lake the communication [through Leech Lake river] is
direct and without any impediment. This is rather considered
as the main source, although the Winipeque Branch is
navigable the greatest distance.</p>

<p>To this place the whole face of the country has an appearance
of an impenetrable morass or boundless savanna. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
on the borders of the lake is some oak, with large groves of
sugar-maple, from which the traders make sufficient sugar
for their consumption the whole year. Leech Lake communicates
with the river De Corbeau by seven portages,
and with the river Des Feuilles; also, with the Red river,
by the Otter Tail Lake on the one side, and by [Upper] Red
Cedar Lake and other small lakes to Red Lake on the other.
Out of these small lakes and ridges rise the upper waters
of the St. Lawrence, Mississippi,<a name="FNanchor_VII-23" id="FNanchor_VII-23" href="#Footnote_VII-23" class="fnanchor">[VII-23]</a> and Red river, the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327-333</a></span>
of which discharges itself into the ocean by Lake Winipie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"></a></span>
Nelson's River, and Hudson's Bay. All those waters have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329"></a></span>
their upper sources within 100 miles of each other, which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"></a></span>
think plainly proves this to be the most elevated part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"></a></span>
N. E. continent of America. But we must cross what is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"></a></span>
commonly termed the Rocky Mountains, or a Spur of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"></a></span>
Cordeliers [Cordilleras], previous to our finding the waters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
whose currents run westward and pay tribute to the western
ocean.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335-337</a></span></p>

<p>In this quarter we find moose, a very few deer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336"></a></span>
bear, but a vast variety of fur animals of all descriptions.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<br />
<span class="s08">ETHNOGRAPHY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.<a name="FNanchor_VIII-1" id="FNanchor_VIII-1" href="#Footnote_VIII-1" class="fnanchor">[VIII-1]</a></span></h2>

<p>The first nation of Indians whom we met with in ascending
the Mississippi from St. Louis were the Sauks,
who principally reside in four villages. The first at the
head of the rapids De Moyen on the W. shore, consisting of
13 log lodges; the second on a prairie on the E. shore,
about 60 miles above; the third on the Riviere De Roche,
about three miles from the entrance; and the fourth on the
river Iowa.</p>

<p>They hunt on the Mississippi and its confluent streams,
from the Illinois to the river Des Iowa; and on the plains
west of them, which border the Missouri. They are so perfectly
consolidated with the Reynards<a name="FNanchor_VIII-2" id="FNanchor_VIII-2" href="#Footnote_VIII-2" class="fnanchor">[VIII-2]</a> that they scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
can be termed a distinct nation; but recently there appears
to be a schism between the two nations, the latter not approving
of the insolence and ill-will which has marked the
conduct of the former toward the United States on many
late occurrences. They have for many years past, under
the auspices of the Sioux, made war on the Sauteaux,
Osages, and Missouries; but as recently a peace has been
made between them and the nations of the Missouri through
the influence of the United States, and by the same means
between the Sioux and Sauteaux, their principal allies, it appears
that it would by no means be a difficult matter to
induce them to make a general peace, and pay still greater
attention to the cultivation of the earth; as they now raise
a considerable quantity of corn, beans, and melons. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
character that they bear with their savage brethren is that
they are much more to be dreaded for their deceit and
inclination for stratagem than for their open courage.</p>

<p>The Reynards reside in three villages. The first is on the
W. side of the Mississippi, six miles above the rapids of the
River De Roche; the second is about 12 miles in the rear of
the lead mines; and the third is on Turkey river, half a
league from its entrance. They are engaged in the same
wars and have the same alliances as the Sauks, with whom
they must be considered as indissoluble in war or peace.
They hunt on both sides of the Mississippi from the Iowa,
below Prairie Des Chiens to a river of that name [Upper
Iowa], above said village. They raise a great quantity of
corn, beans, and melons; the former of those articles in such
quantities as to sell many hundred bushels per annum.</p>

<p>The Iowas reside on the De Moyen and Iowa rivers in two
villages. They hunt on the W. side of the Mississippi, the
De Moyen, and westward to the Missouri; their wars and
alliances are the same as those of the Sauks and Reynards,
under whose special protection they conceive themselves to
be. They cultivate some corn, but not so much in proportion
as the Sauks and Reynards. Their residence being on
the small streams in the rear of the Mississippi, out of the
highroad of commerce, renders them less civilized than
those nations.</p>

<p>The Sauks, Reynards, and Iowas, since the treaty of the
two former with the United States [in 1804], claim the
land from the entrance of the Jauflioni [see <a href="#Footnote_I-14">note<sup>14</sup></a>, p. 11],
on the W. side of the Mississippi, up the latter river to the
Des Iowa, above Prairie Des Chiens, and westward to the
Missouri; but the limits between themselves are undefined.
All the land formerly claimed by those nations E. of the
Mississippi is now ceded to the United States; but they
have reserved to themselves the privilege of hunting and
residing on it, as usual.</p>

<p>By killing the celebrated Sauk chief Pontiac, the Illinois,
Cahokias, Kaskaskias, and Piorias kindled a war with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
allied nations of Sauks and Reynards, which has been the
cause of the almost entire destruction of the former nations.</p>

<p>The Winebagos or Puants are a nation who reside on the
rivers Ouiscousing, De Roche, Fox, and Green Bay, in seven
villages, which are situated as follows: 1st, at the entrance
of Green Bay; 2d, at the end of Green Bay; 3d, at Wuckan
[Lake Poygan], on Fox river; 4th, at Lake Puckway; 5th,
at the portage of the Ouiscousing; 6th and 7th, on Roche
river.</p>

<p>Those villages are so situated that the Winebagos can
embody the whole force of their nation, at any one point of
their territory, in four days. They hunt on the Ouiscousing
and Rock rivers, and E. side of the Mississippi, from Rock
river to Prairie Des Chiens; on Lake Michigan, Black river,
and in the country between Lakes Michigan, Huron, and
Superior. From the tradition amongst them, and their
speaking the same language as the Otos of the Riviere
Platte, I am confident in asserting that they are a nation
who have emigrated from Mexico to avoid the oppression
of the Spaniards; and the time may be fixed at about 1Â½
centuries past, when they were taken under the protection
of the Sioux, to whom they still profess to owe faith, and at
least brotherly attention. They have formerly been at war
with the nations west of the Mississippi, but appear recently
to have laid down the hatchet. They are reputed brave,
but from every circumstance their neighbors distinguish
their bravery as the ferocity of a tiger, rather than the deliberate
resolution of a man; and recently their conduct has
been such as to authorize the remark made by a chief of a
neighboring nation, that "a white man never should lie
down to sleep without precaution in their villages."</p>

<p>The Menomene or Fols Avoins, as they are termed by the
French, reside in seven villages, situated as follows: 1st, at
the Menomene river, 15 leagues from Green Bay, on the north
side of the lake; 2d, at Green Bay; 3d, at Little Kakalin;
4th, at portage of Kakalin; 5th, on Stinking Lake [Winnebago];
6th, at the entrance of a small lake [Lac Butte des
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Morts] on Fox river; and 7th, behind the Bank of the
Dead [Butte des Morts]. Their hunting-grounds are similar
to those of the Winebagos; only that, owing to the
very high estimation in which they are held both by Sioux
and Chipeways, they are frequently permitted to hunt near
Raven river on the Mississippi, which may be termed the
battle-ground between those two great nations. The language
which they speak is singular, for no white man has
ever yet been known to acquire it; but this may probably
be attributed to their understanding the Algonquin, in which
they and the Winebagos transact all conferences with the
whites or other nations; and the facility with which that
language is acquired is a further reason for its prevalence.</p>

<p>The Fols Avoins, although a small nation, are respected
by all their neighbors for their bravery and independent
spirit, and esteemed by the whites as their friends and protectors.
When in the country I heard their chief assert in
council with the Sioux and Chipeways, that although they
were reduced to few in number, yet they could say, "we
never were slaves," as they had always preferred that their
women and children should die by their own hands, to their
being led into slavery by their enemies. The boundary of
their territory is uncertain. The Sauks, Reynards, Puants,
and Menomenes all reside, when not at their villages, in
lodges in the form of an ellipsis; some are from 30 to 40 feet
in length by 14 or 15 wide, and are sufficiently large to
shelter 60 people from the storm, or for 20 to reside in.
Their covering is rushes plaited into mats, and carefully
tied to the poles. In the center are the fires, immediately
over which is a small vacancy in the lodge, which in fair
weather is sufficient to give vent to the smoke; but in bad
weather you must lie down on the ground to prevent being
considerably incommoded by it.</p>

<p>We next come to that powerful nation the Sioux, the
dread of whom is extended over all the Savage nations, from
the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri to Raven
river on the former, and to the Snake [Shoshone] Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
on the latter. But in those limits are many nations whom
they consider as allies, on a similar footing with the allies of
ancient Rome, <i>i. e.</i>, humble dependents. But the Chipeway
nation is an exception, who have maintained a long contest
with them, owing to their country being intersected by numerous
small lakes, water-courses, impenetrable morasses, and
swamps; and have hitherto bid defiance to all the attacks of
their neighbors. It is necessary to divide the Sioux nation
into the different bands, as distinguished amongst themselves,
in order to have a correct idea of them.</p>

<p>Agreeably to this plan, I shall begin with the Minowa
Kantong [Mdewakantonwans] or Gens De Lac, who extend
from Prairie Des Chiens to La Prairie du Francois [vicinity
of Shakopee, Chaska, etc.], 35 miles up the St. Peters. This
band is again subdivided into four divisions, under different
chiefs. The first of these most generally reside at their village
on the Upper Iowa river, above Prairie Des Chiens, and
are commanded by Wabasha, a chief whose father was considered
as the first chief of all the Sioux nation. This subdivision
hunts on both sides of the Mississippi and its confluent
streams, from Prairie Des Chiens to the riviere du
B&oelig;uf. The second subdivision resides near the head of Lake
Pepin, and hunts from the riviere du B&oelig;uf to near the St.
Croix. Their chief's name is Tantangamani&mdash;a very celebrated
war-chief. The third subdivision resides between the
riviere au Canon and the entrance of the St. Peters, headed
by Chatewaconamani. Their principal hunting-ground is on
the St. Croix. They have a village [Kapoja] at a place
called Grand Marais [Pig's Eye lake], 15 miles below the entrance
of the St. Peters. It is situated on the east bank of
the Mississippi, and consists of 11 log huts. The fourth
subdivision is situated from the entrance of the St. Peters
to the Prairie Des Francois; they are headed by a chief
called Chatamutah, but a young man, Wyaganage, has
recently taken the lead in all the councils and affairs of state
of this sub-band. They have one village, nine miles up the
St. Peters, on the N. side. This band (Minowa Kantong)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
are reputed the bravest of all the Sioux, and have for years
been opposed to the Fols Avoin Sauteurs, who are reputed
the bravest of all the numerous bands of Chipeways.</p>

<p>The second band of Sioux are the Washpetong [Waqpetonwan]
or Gens Des Fieulles [Feuilles], who inhabit the
country from the Prairie De Francois to near Roche Blanche,
on the St. Peters. Their first chief is Wasonquianni. They
hunt on the St. Peters, also on the Mississippi, up Rum
river, and sometimes follow the buffalo on the plains. Their
subdivisions I am unacquainted with.</p>

<p>The third band are the Sussitongs [Sisitonwans or Sissetons];
they extend from the Roche Blanche [White Rock]
to Lac de Gross Roche [Big Stone or Inyantonka lake], on
the river St. Peters; they are divided into two subdivisions.
The first, called the Cawrees [Kahras], are headed by the
chief called Wuckiew Nutch or Tonnere Rouge [Red Thunder].
The second, the Sussitongs proper, are headed by
Wacantoe or Esprit Blue [Blue Spirit]. These two sub-bands
hunt eastward to the Mississippi, and up that river
as far as the Riviere De Corbeau.</p>

<p>The fourth great band are the Yanctongs [Ihanktonwans
or Yanktons], who are dispersed from the Montaignes
[Coteau] De la Prairie, which extends from St. Peters to the
Missouri, to the De Moyen. They are divided into two
grand divisions, generally termed Yanctongs of the North,
and Yanctongs of the South [Yanktonnais and Yanktons].
The former are headed by a chief called Muckpeanutah or
Nuage Rouge [Red Cloud]; and those of the Prairie, by
Petessung. This band are never stationary, but with the
Titongs are the most erratic of all the Sioux, sometimes to
be found on the borders of the Lower Red River, sometimes
on the Missouri, and on those immense plains which
are between the two rivers.</p>

<p>The fifth great band are the Titongs [Titonwans, commonly
called Tetons], who are dispersed on both sides of
the Missouri; on the north, principally from the river Chienne
[Cheyenne] up; and on the south, from the Mahas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
[Omahas] to the Minetares, or Gross Ventres [Hidatsas].
They may be divided into the Titongs of the North and
South; but the immense plains over which they rove with
the Yanctongs renders it impossible to point out their place
of habitation.</p>

<p>The sixth, last, and smallest band of the Sioux are the
Washpecoute [Waqpekute or Wahkpakotoan], who reside
generally on the lands west of the Mississippi, between
that river and the Missouri. They hunt most generally
on the head of the De Moyen. They appeared to me to
be the most stupid and inactive of all the Sioux.</p>

<p>The Minowa Kantongs are the only band of Sioux who
use canoes, and by far the most civilized, being the only
ones who have ever built log huts, or cultivated any species
of vegetables, and among those only a very small quantity
of corn and beans; for, although I was with them in
September or October, I never saw one kettle of either,
they always using wild oats for bread. This production
nature has furnished to all the most uncultivated nations
of the N. W. continent, who may gather in autumn a sufficiency
which, when added to the productions of the chase
and the net, insures them a subsistence through all the
seasons of the year. This band is entirely armed with firearms,
but is not considered by the other bands as anything
superior on that account, especially on the plains.</p>

<p>The Washpetong are a roving band; they leave the St.
Peters in the month of April, and do not return from the
plains until the middle of August. The Sussitongs of Roche
Blanche have the character of being the most evil-disposed
Indians on the St. Peters. They likewise follow the buffalo
in the spring and summer months. The Sussitongs of Lac
de Gross Roche [Big Stone Lake], under Tonnere Rouge,
have the character of good hunters and brave warriors, which
may principally be attributed to their chief, Tonnere Rouge,
who at the present day is allowed by both white people and
the savages of the different bands to be (after their own chiefs)
the first man in the Sioux nation. The Yanctongs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Titongs are the most independent Indians in the world;
they follow the buffalo as chance directs, clothing themselves
with the skins, and making their lodges, bridles, and
saddles of the same materials, the flesh of the animal furnishing
their food. Possessing innumerable herds of horses,
they are here this day, 500 miles off ten days hence, and
find themselves equally at home in either place, moving with
a rapidity scarcely to be imagined by the inhabitants of the
civilized world.</p>

<p>The trade of the Minowa Kantongs, Washpetongs, Sussitongs,
and part of the Yanctongs, is all derived from the
traders of Michilimackinac; and the latter of those two
bands supply the Yanctongs of the North and Titongs with
the small quantities of iron works [hardware] which they
require. Firearms are not in much estimation with them.
The Washpecoute trade principally with the people of
Prairie Des Chiens; but for a more particular explanation of
this subject, please to refer to the table.<a name="FNanchor_VIII-3" id="FNanchor_VIII-3" href="#Footnote_VIII-3" class="fnanchor">[VIII-3]</a></p>

<p>The claims of limits of the Sioux nation are allowed by
all their neighbors to commence at Prairie Des Chiens, and
ascend the Mississippi on both sides to the Riviere De Corbeau;
up that river to its source; thence to the source of
the St. Peters; thence to the Montaigne De La Prairie;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
thence to the Missouri; down that river to the Mahas, bearing
thence N. E. to the source of the De Moyen; and thence
to the place of beginning. They also claim a large territory
south of the Missouri, but how far it extends is uncertain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
The country E. of the Mississippi, from Rum river to the
Riviere De Corbeau, is likewise in dispute between them
and the Chipeways, and has been the scene of many a sharp
encounter for near 150 years past.</p>

<p>From my knowledge of the Sioux nation, I do not hesitate
to pronounce them the most warlike and independent
nation of Indians within the boundaries of the United
States, their every passion being subservient to that of war;
at the same time that their traders feel themselves perfectly
secure of any combination being made against themselves,
it is extremely necessary to be careful not to injure the
honor or feelings of an individual, which is certainly the
principal cause of the many broils which occur between
them. But never was a trader known to suffer in the estimation
of the nation by resenting any indignity offered him,
even if it went to taking the life of the offender. Their guttural
pronunciation, high cheek bones, their visages, and distinct
manners, together with their own traditions, supported
by the testimony of neighboring nations, puts it in my mind
beyond the shadow of a doubt that they have emigrated
from the N. W. point of America, to which they have come
across the narrow streight which in that quarter divides the
two continents, and are absolutely descendants of a Tartarean
tribe.</p>

<p>The only personal knowledge which I have of the Chipeway
nation is restricted to the tribes on the south side of
Lake Superior, on the headwaters of the Chipeway and the
St. Croix; and to those who reside at Sandy Lake, Leech
Lake, Rainy Lake, Red Lake, and the heads of the rivers
Rouge, Mississippi, and De Corbeau. They are divided,
like the Sioux, into many bands, the names of only seven of
which I am acquainted with.</p>

<p>[1st.] I shall begin with those who reside on the south
side of Lake Superior, and on Lakes De Sable and Sang
Sue, with the adjacent country. They are generally
denominated by the traders by the name of Sauteuxs,
but those of the headwaters of the Chipeway and St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Croix rivers are called Fols Avoin Sauteurs. I am unacquainted
with the names of their chiefs. Those of Sandy
Lake are headed by a chief called Catawabata, or De
Breche [BrÃ¨che-dent]. They hunt on Mille Lacs, Red
Lake, the east bank of the Mississippi from Rum river
up to the Des Corbeau, and thence on both sides of
the Mississippi to Pine river; on that river also, up the
Mississippi to Lake De Sable, and about 100 miles above
that lake. Those of Leech Lake hunt on its streams, Lake
Winipie [Winnibigoshish], Upper Red Cedar Lake, Otter
Tail Lake, head of the De Corbeau, and the upper part of
Lower Red river. Their chief is Le Gieulle [La Gueule]
Platte, or Eskibugeckoge [Flat Mouth].</p>

<p>2d. The Crees reside on Red lake, and hunt in its vicinity
and on Red river. Their first chief's name is Wiscoup, or
Le Sucre.</p>

<p>3d. The Nepesangs reside on Lake Nippising and Lake
St. Joseph.</p>

<p>4th. The Algonquins reside on the Lake of the two
Mountains, and are dispersed along the north sides of Lakes
Ontario and Erie. From this tribe the language of the
Chipeways derives its name, and the whole nation is frequently
designated by that appellation.</p>

<p>5th. The Otoways [Ottawas] reside on the N. W. side of
Lake Michigan and Lake Huron; and hunt between those
lakes and Lake Superior.</p>

<p>6th. The Iroquois Chipeways are dispersed along the
banks of all the Great Lakes, from Ontario to the Lake of
the Woods.</p>

<p>7th. The Muscononges reside on the waters of Lower Red
river, near to Lake Winipie [Winnipeg], and are the furthest
band of Chipeways.</p>

<p>The Chipeways were the great and almost natural enemies
of the Sioux, with whom they had been waging a war of
extermination for near two centuries. On my arrival among
them I succeeded in inducing both sides to agree to a peace,
and no blood was shed from Sept., 1805, to Apr., 1806, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
I left the country. This object had frequently been in vain
attempted by the British government, who often brought
the chiefs of the two nations together at Michilimackinac,
made them presents, etc. But the Sioux, still haughty and
overbearing, spurned the proffered calumet, and returned to
renew the scenes of slaughter and barbarity. It may then
be demanded, how could a subaltern with 20 men, and no
presents worthy of notice, effect that which the governors
of Canada, with all the immense finances of the Indian department,
had attempted in vain, although they frequently
and urgently recommended it? I reply that it is true the
British government requested, recommended, and made
presents&mdash;but all this at a distance; and when the chiefs
returned to their bands, their thirst for blood soon obliterated
from their recollection the lectures of humanity which
they had heard in the councils of Michilimackinac. But
when I appeared amongst them the United States had lately
acquired jurisdiction over them, and the names of the
Americans as warriors had frequently been sounded in their
ears; when I spoke to them on the subject I commanded
them, in the name of their great father, to make peace;
offered them the benefit of the mediation and guarantee of
the United States; and spoke of the peace, not as a benefit
to us, but a step taken to make themselves and their children
happy. This language, held up to both nations with
the assistance of the traders, was a happy coincidence of
circumstances; and (may I not add?) the assistance of the
Almighty effected that which had long been attempted in
vain. But I am perfectly convinced that, unless troops are
sent up between those two nations, with an agent whose
business it would be to watch the rising discontents and
check the brooding spirit of revenge, the weapons of death
will again be raised, and the echoes of savage barbarity will
resound through the wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_VIII-4" id="FNanchor_VIII-4" href="#Footnote_VIII-4" class="fnanchor">[VIII-4]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

<p>The Chipeways are uncommonly attached to spirituous
liquors; but may not this be owing to their traders, who
find it much to their [own] interest to encourage their [the
Chipeways'] thirst after an article which enables them [the
traders] to obtain their [the Chipeways'] peltries at so low a
rate as scarcely to be denominated a consideration, and
have reduced the people near the establishments to a degree
of degradation unparalleled?</p>

<p>The Algonquin language is one of the most copious and
sonorous languages of all the savage dialects in North
America; and is spoken and understood by the various
nations, except the Sioux, from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to
Lake Winipie [Winnipeg].</p>

<p>This nation is much more mild and docile than the Sioux,
and if we may judge from unprejudiced observers, more
cool and deliberate in action. But the latter possess a much
higher sense of the honor of their nation: the others plan
for self-preservation. The Sioux attacks with impetuosity;
the other defends with every necessary precaution. But the
superior numbers of the Sioux would have enabled them to
annihilate the Chipeways long since had it not been for
the nature of their [the Chipeways'] country, which entirely
precludes the possibility of an attack on horseback. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
also gives them a decided advantage over an enemy half
armed with arrows, as the least twig of a bush will turn
the shaft of death out of its direction; whereas, the whizzing
bullet holds its course nor spends its force short of the
destined victim. Thus we generally have found that when
engaged in a prairie the Sioux came off victorious; but if
in the woods, even if not obliged to retreat, the carcasses of
their slaughtered brethren showed how dearly they purchased
the victory.</p>

<p>The Sioux are bounded on the N. E. and N. by these
two powerful nations, the Chipeways and Knisteneaux
[Crees], whose manners, strength, and boundaries are ably
described by Sir Alexander McKenzie. The Assinniboins,
or Stone Sioux, who border the Chipeways on the N. W.
and W., are a revolted band of the Sioux, who have maintained
war with the parent nation for about a century, and
have rendered themselves their most violent enemies. They
extend from the Red river W. nearly to the Rocky Mountains,
and are computed at 1,500 warriors. They reside on
the plains, and follow the buffalo; consequently they have
very little occasion for traders or European productions.

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_OP-1" id="Footnote_OP-1" href="#FNanchor_OP-1"><span class="label">[OP-1]</span></a> The publisher owes it to truth, and to Colonel Pike, to state that he very
much doubts whether any book ever went to press under so many disadvantages
as the one now presented to the public. Some of those disadvantages must be
obvious to every man who reads the work; but there are many others of a
nature not sufficiently interesting for publication, yet of sufficient magnitude to
retard the work, embarrass the publisher, and impose more anxiety than has
fallen to his lot in the various books which he has published. It is, however,
confidently believed that, notwithstanding all those circumstances, the Journal
and its Appendixes will be found particularly interesting and pregnant with
important information.</p>

<p class="footnote">Sir</p>

<p class="footnote">I have taken the liberty of making out my accounts of Pay Forrage and Subsistance
from the 1<sup>t</sup> of January to the 31<sup>t</sup> ins<sup>t</sup> and forwarded them to the Pay

or communications from Him. I need not mention how disagreeable a state
of Suspense is, nor, to move your sympathy, to say more than that the anxiety and
concern, exhibited for His safety, by an affectionate Mother and Wife, is Great.
By way of consolation to the former, I have thought proper to extend the
probable Period of His return, untill this month; Mrs Pike is now begining to
lose confidence in my opinion, consequently my consolating influence is daily
lesening, and Her afflictions increasing&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_M-7" id="Footnote_M-7" href="#FNanchor_M-7"><span class="label">[M-7]</span></a> John De Barth Walbach was a native of Germany, who was commissioned
from Pennsylvania as a lieutenant of Light Dragoons Jan. 8th, 1799, and honorably
discharged June 15th, 1800. He re-entered the service as a lieutenant

to the Corps of Artillery May 12th, 1814. During the war he served in

1818, and was transferred to the 1st Artillery June 1st, 1821; promoted to be
lieutenant-colonel May 30th, 1832, and to be colonel of the 4th Artillery

and faithful services; his latest brevet being that of brigadier-general Nov.
11th, 1823. General Walbach died June 10th, 1857. An unpublished letter
before me, from General Wilkinson to the Secretary of War, dated St. Louis,
Nov. 26th, 1805, refers to Lieutenant Walbach in the following terms: "In
every cavalry arrangement I must beg leave to call Walbach to your recollection,
as the ablest horse officer in America, not only in the choice of animals, but in
equipping, training, forming, and heading them to action."</p>

<p class="footnote">Alexander Macomb was commander-in-chief of the army from May 29th,
1828, to his death, June 25th, 1841. He was brevetted major-general Sept.

and gallant conduct at Plattsburgh, N. Y. General Macomb entered
the army as a cornet of Light Dragoons Jan. 10th, 1799; attained the rank of
brigadier-general in 1814, and major-general in 1828.</p>

<p class="footnote">Jonathan Williams, of Massachusetts, was appointed from Pennsylvania a
major of the 2d Artillerists and Engineers Feb. 16th, 1801; he served as
inspector of fortifications from Dec. 14th, 1801, to June 1st, 1802, and was
retained as major of Engineers April 1st, 1802. He resigned June 20th, 1803;
was made lieutenant-colonel and chief engineer Apr. 19th, 1805, and promoted
to be colonel Feb. 23d, 1808. He resigned again July 31st, 1812,
and died May 20th, 1815.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_M-8" id="Footnote_M-8" href="#FNanchor_M-8"><span class="label">[M-8]</span></a> Note by Lieutenant J. R. Williams, May 19th, 1894: "The foregoing is
a literal copy of the rough draft of John R. Williams' letter to Major Holton.
The fair copy of course is not in my possession, but I have reason to believe
the fair copy must contain several of the peculiar errors of the writer, whose
early education was wholly French, so that he never, as far as I know, capitalized
the initial letters of such words as <i>English</i> and <i>French</i>. John R. Williams,
writer of this letter, entered the 2d U.Â S. Infantry as a cadet early in 1800, but
appears to have resigned in about six months. He was subsequently connected
with the same regiment for about a year in the capacity of agent of the contractor
for commissary supplies. The title of general, by which he is well
remembered in Detroit, was acquired by his connection with the militia of
Michigan for about 40 years, as adjutant-general and major-general."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_M-9" id="Footnote_M-9" href="#FNanchor_M-9"><span class="label">[M-9]</span></a> This is a remarkable book, which has had a very exceptional career, the
end of which is not even yet. Robert Dodsley, b. 1703, d. Sept. 23d, 1764,
was in early life a menial in the service of Hon. Mrs. Lowther, but became by
his natural talents a wealthy publisher, as well as a prolific author. In the
latter capacity he was scarcely rated as more than a hack writer in his lifetime,
during which he was probably never suspected of having written an immortal
book. Whether this was a stroke of his own genius or not is questionable;
but he should have the full credit of the book, until an extraneous source of his
inspiration can be instanced. The &OElig;conomy of Human Life was first published
anonymously in a collection of miscellanies, in 1745, and soon acquired
great repute, in part at least due to the fact that it was commonly attributed to
Lord Chesterfield. It ran through many editions in various styles, some of
them finely illustrated. The earlier ones all preserved the author's anonymity,
and in more than one reprint of very late years his incognito is formally preserved.
An anonymous edition of 1806, which I have handled, consists only of
Book I, Parts i-vii, entitled as follows: The   |   &OElig;conomy   |   of   |   Human Life, |
translated from an   |   Indian Manuscript,   |   written by an Ancient Bramin   |   &mdash; |
London:   |   printed for W. Gardiner, Pall-Mall; and   |   Vernor, Hood, and
Sharpe, Poultny.   |   1 vol., 12mo, pp. i-x, 1 leaf, pp. 1-116, and many engr.
head- and tail-pieces. Another, of 1809, with the authorship avowed, is as
follows: The   |   Economy   |   of   |   Human Life.   |   In Two Books.   |   &mdash;   |   By Robert
Dodsley.   |   &mdash;   |   With six elegant engravings by Mackenzie,   |   from designs by
Craig and Unwins.   |   &mdash;   |   London:   |   [etc., 4 lines of printers' names]   |   &mdash; |
1809. 1 vol., 16mo, 1 prel. leaf, vignette title, pp. i-xviii, 5-188; portrait and
memoir of Dodsley, and 5 full-page engravings; said to have been pub.
Jan. 31st, 1809. The copy Pike had was most probably one of the cheap
American reprints which appeared about this time. Dodsley's book consists of
philosophical and moral reflections or aphorisms in curt, sententious style, of
distinctly Oriental flavor; it is feigned to be based upon manuscripts of
immense antiquity, discovered in the capital of Tibet by an emissary of the
emperor of China, and in some occult manner received in England and translated.
I liked the thing so much that I lately brought out a new edition myself,
preserving the author's feigned origin of the book and his own incognito, transposing
some of the pieces, adding a new "foreword" in antique style, and
modifying the title to&mdash;Kuthumi: The True and Complete &OElig;conomy of
Human Life, etc. In this guise Dodsley's book forms No. 5 of my Biogen

the tract entitled: Materials for the Future History of Minnesota, etc., the
same being Part V. of the publications of the Minn. Hist. Soc., 8vo, St. Paul,
1856, pp. about 142. The five separately issued Parts, dating 1850-56, were in
1872 collectively republished in a second edition, forming Vol. I. of the Collections
of the Minn. Hist. Soc., 8vo, pp. 1-519. In this reprint the article is
entitled: Pike's Explorations in Minnesota, 1805-06, and occupies pp. 368-416,
or 48 pages, being thus about as extensive as the text of 1807. The editor
says that his aim was "to make judicious extracts" from Pike's journal; and
he certainly succeeded in this intention. The editor's name does not appear;
but as the footnotes which explain or amplify various points in the text are
signed "W.," an initial of Mr. J. Fletcher Williams, who was secretary of the
society and editor of its publications for many years, the work is presumably
his, being thus an authentic as well as a genuine account of the Mississippi
voyage. This publication therefore ranks side by side with the original
unknown editor's performance, though the two are separated by an interval of
half a century.</p>

published in his absence on duty." This is true only in so far as the forerunner
of the Mississippi voyage is concerned (see above, <a href="#Page_XXXIII">p. xxxiii</a>,) and conveys an
erroneous impression regarding Pike's princeps edition, in which the plagiarism
occurs. For Pike wrote this book himself, and necessarily knew everything

<span class="i2">"REPORT OF A LATE OCCURRENCE IN THIS PROVINCE OF NEW MEXICO.</span></p>

<p class="footnote">"On the 15th of February last two Indians of the Ute tribe arrived and
brought into my presence an Anglo-American, a young man of genteel appearance
[joben de presencia fina, as Dr. Robinson appeared to be], whose statement
I heard, and even invited him to dine with me, in order to satisfy myself
he was what I supposed him to be as to intelligence and good breeding.</p>

<p class="footnote">"I did not believe him, and suspecting the truth of his statement as to the
nature of his escort, I sent out a small regular detachment and some provincial
troops to reconnoitre, who not only fell in with a first lieutenant with six
soldiers in an excellent fort built on the Conejos not far from its junction with
the Del Norte, two days' journey from the capital of this province, towards the
same direction [acia el mismo rumbo], but overcoming the obstacles of deep
snows, succeeded in finding the sergeant [Meek] and corporal [meaning Private
Miller] belonging to the detachment, making a total of thirteen soldiers, two of
them [Dougherty and Sparks] with frozen feet, and having lost nearly all their
fingers. [Compare <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_510">p. 510</a>, beyond.]</p>

<p class="footnote">"On the 2d of March last, the above-mentioned lieutenant, whose name is
Mungo-Meri-Paike, came in with six men of his detachment, and on the 18th
the remainder of his men. Without any resistance they acquiesced in the notification
made them, that being in my territory it was absolutely necessary that
they should appear before me.</p>

<p class="footnote">"They did so, with their arms, and I assured them that in no respect should
they be treated as prisoners, saving only that, in accordance with the orders of
the general commanding, it was necessary that they should appear before him
and fully explain the objects of their mission.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Paike showed me his instructions from General Wilkinson, his journal, and
a rough sketch of a chart of all the rivers and countries he had explored.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Placing all which papers in a trunk, of which I requested him to retain the
key, I delivered the same to the officer [Capitan Antonio D'Almansa: see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_611">p. 611</a>]
commanding his escort&mdash;not to be opened save in presence of the aforesaid
general commanding.</p>

<p class="footnote">"From all which circumstances, from what I gathered from Robinson and
from the above named officer, I conclude distinctly that the expedition of July
[last&mdash;1806] was specially designed to conciliate two Indian tribes in behalf of
the U.Â S. Government, to make them liberal presents, and drawing them into
friendship, treaty, and commerce, to place them under the Anglo-American protection&mdash;all
this referring especially to the Comanche tribe, the most powerful
of our allies.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Furthermore, that the Anglo-American government considers as included
within the boundaries of Louisiana all the rivers that empty into the Mississippi,
and all the territories that extend to the head waters of the Rio Colorado [meaning
that Red r. which is the branch of the Arkansaw now called the Canadian r.
as Meline explains in a footnote], which rises a few leagues from the pueblo
of Taos further to the north in this province; that it is their intention this year
or the next to establish forts or settlements on all these rivers, in order to monopolize
all the trade and commerce carried on by a large number of tribes in the
province.</p>

<p class="footnote">"The detachment of Anglo-American troops referred to, went to Chihuahua
to appear before the commanding general, guarded by an escort, being allowed
to carry their arms and ammunition on account of the danger of hostile Apaches
on the route.</p>

<p class="footnote">"All of which is submitted to the general commanding, reminding him of the
representation made in my communication of the 4th of January last year, concerning
the necessity of placing this province on a respectable footing, and of
having frontier posts and positions thrown out to oppose the ambitious views of
the aforesaid Anglo-American government, exposing also the wretchedly defenseless
condition actually existing, and so found for years past by whomsoever has
been in command.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_M-13" id="Footnote_M-13" href="#FNanchor_M-13"><span class="label">[M-13]</span></a> The reputation of General Wilkinson for honor and patriotism went under
a cloud, from which it has never been cleared, in connection with the Burr
conspiracy. He was technically acquitted, from lack of evidence to convict;
but the proof that he was a mercenary traitor subsequently appeared. General
Winfield Scott is reported to have called him an "unprincipled imbecile."
Governor Adams has lately put the case bluntly, but as I believe truthfully,
Address, July 12th, 1894, p. 20: "General Wilkinson, then in command of the
western army, has been proven by recently discovered documents to have been
'a rascal through and through.' He was in sympathy and perhaps in the confidence
of Burr. Wearing the uniform and sword of an American officer, he
was in the pay of Spain, and conspired to create out of the colonies west of the
mountains a Spanish empire. It was Wilkinson who sent Pike west; but no
matter how guilty may have been his superior in command, Pike certainly had
no knowledge of his schemes. Pike was innocent of any stain. He was a
patriot as pure and sincere as Wilkinson was a traitor base and ungrateful."
While there is no question of Pike's perfervid patriotism, we may doubt that his
lamb's-wool was as white as all that; in fact, Governor Adams himself goes on
to say: "It is not entirely clear that Pike was as innocent as he professed of his
whereabouts when captured in the San Luis valley. Some believe he knew he
was upon the Rio Grande, and not upon the Red [river], as he pretended to
believe. But had it been the Red instead of the Rio Grande, what right had he
to be on the south [<i>i. e.</i>, west] side of the river, his rude fort being several miles
south [west] of the stream and under an abeyance treaty upon forbidden ground?
The Spaniards believed that Pike carried secret orders to intrude upon their
territory."</p>

<p class="footnote">This belief of the Spaniards was well founded: compare my notes at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Page_499">p. 499</a>,

Colonel Meline corroborates the general tenor and
purport of these observations, in the following terms, p. 313 of his work already
cited:</p>

<p class="footnote">"Wilkinson's bulky and diffuse published memoirs may be searched in vain
for any information concerning Pike's expedition, and his silence on the subject
is, to say the least, suggestive.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Of his complicity with Burr but little doubt is now entertained and proofs
are not wanting of the existence of his designs upon Mexico, from the period of
his note in cypher to Governor Gayoso de Lemas (February, 1797), and his
dealings with [Captain Philip] Nolan, down to the conspiracy of 1806.</p>

<p class="footnote">"It has been stated that Wilkinson himself planned the exploring expedition
of Pike, in order to obtain for his own purposes a more perfect knowledge of the
country, and that he availed himself of his official authority to have it ordered
by the Government. [See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43775/43775-h/43775-h.htm#Footnote_VI-2">note<sup>2</sup>, p. 564</a>.]</p>

<p class="footnote">"The Mississippi Herald of September 15th, 1807, published the affidavit of
Judge Timothy Kibby, of the Louisiana Territory, acting Chief Justice of the
Court of Common Pleas for the district of St. Charles.</p>

<p class="footnote">"The affidavit sets forth&mdash;</p>

<p class="footnote">"'That in confidential conversation the general (Wilkinson) speaking of
Pike's Expedition, upon inquiry, replied, smiling, that it was of a <i>secret
nature</i>, and that Lieutenant Pike himself was not apprised of the ultimate
object of the expedition, but that his destination was Santa FÃ©, treating with
the Indians as he advanced.</p>

<p class="footnote">"'He (Wilkinson) intimated that Lieutenant Pike had been dispatched by
<i>his orders</i>; that the plan was his own, not emanating from the Government, but
assented to.'"</p>

<p class="footnote">With these pertinent particulars I could&mdash;but need not&mdash;forbear to couple
the racy characterization given by Mr. Prentis, p. 198 of his Kansan Abroad:</p>

<p class="footnote">"The military officer in charge of the western country at that time [1806]
was General James Wilkinson, a restless, bombastic, fussy old gentleman, with a
rare faculty for getting into difficulties. As an officer in the Revolutionary army,
he was concerned in the [Thomas] Conway cabal, a plot to supplant Washington,
and place in his stead General Gates, an officer who afterwards got beautifully
thrashed by the British at Camden. He turned up in the army, after being for
a while a merchant at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1791; received Louisiana from
the French in 1803, and contrived to get mixed up in the Burr business to such
an extent that nobody knows to this day, I believe, which side he was on. He
was investigated, court-martialed, and acquitted; went into the war of 1812;
served on the Canadian frontier; was a conspicuous failure; was court-martialed
again [subjected to a court of inquiry], and again acquitted; and finally, there
being in those days no chance to enter the lecture field, he wrote his memoirs
[1816], and retired to the City of Mexico, where he died.</p>

<p class="footnote">"General James Wilkinson in his day was probably the subject of more
uncomplimentary remarks than any man of his caliber in the country, and I
deem it no more than justice to say for him, that, with all his faults, he was the
steadfast friend of Zebulon M. Pike."</p>

<p class="footnote">I may add, that left-hand compliments to this notorious individual have been
current from that day to this, and are still in order. One of the keenest of them
is attributed to a distinguished contemporary who, it is said, favored his appointment
to the command of the army as the only way of "keeping him out of
mischief"!</p>

<p class="footnote">The following is the formal official record of General Wilkinson: Of Maryland,
appointed from that State colonel and adjutant-general in Gates' army
during the Revolutionary war with brevet of brigadier-general from Nov. 6th,
1777; lieutenant-colonel commanding the 2d Infantry Oct. 22d, 1791;
brigadier-general March 5th, 1792; commander-in-chief of the army from
Dec. 15th, 1796, to July 13th, 1798, and from June 15th, 1800, to Jan. 27th,

discharged. He was reappointed as a captain of Rifles July 1st, 1808;
became major Jan. 20th, 1813, and was brevetted lieutenant-colonel for distinguished
services Feb. 6th, 1813. He was killed in action at Odelltown,
N. Y., June 28th, 1814. "The death of this officer was in harmony with his
character. After the taking of York, finding that the official account of the
action gave him little credit for the conspicuous share he had in it, he became
sick and inactive, and kept himself in sullen seclusion among his own men,
apparently determined that no services should be rendered, either by himself or
his men, since they were so inadequately rewarded, or so unduly estimated. He
did little or nothing the residue of that campaign. Having been promoted before
the following campaign, he, on the Champlain frontier, was put in command of
an advanced party, which was to engage the enemy and then fall back, in order to
draw him into an ambush. Lieutenant-Colonel Forsyth was the last man who
was likely to fulfill such a plan. As soon as he opened the fight with the
enemy, his instructions to fall back were either forgotten or ignored. His
spirit could not brook a retreat, even for an ultimate advantage. He rushed on
and fell, and lost, with his life, all the success that would probably have followed
more prudence, or strict obedience to orders." (Whiting, <i>l. c.</i>)</p>

officer was Lieutenant Fraser, one of Pike's aids, whose own words on the subject
are given in Niles' Register, IV. p. 226: "The general had just aided
in removing a wounded man with his own hands, and sat down on a stump
with a British sergeant we had taken prisoner, whom the general, with Captain
Nicholson and myself, were examining, when the explosion took place. The
general, Captain Nicholson, and the British sergeant, were all mortally
wounded, and I was so much bruised in the general crash, that it is surprising
how I survived; probably I owe my escape to the corpulency of the British
serjeant, whose body was thrown upon mine by the concussion."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_M-29" id="Footnote_M-29" href="#FNanchor_M-29"><span class="label">[M-29]</span></a> The statement that General Sheaffe's retreat was so precipitate that he lost
his papers is confirmed by General Dearborn in a letter to the Secretary of
War, dated Niagara, May 3d, 1813 (Niles' Register, <i>ibid.</i>): "York was a
magazine for Niagara, Detroit, etc., and notwithstanding the immense amount
which was destroyed by them, we found more than we could bring off. Gen.
Sheaffe's baggage and papers fell into my hands; the papers are a valuable
acquisition. A <span class="smcap">scalp</span> was found in the executive and legislative council chamber,
suspended near the speaker's chair in company with the mace, etc."</p>

<p class="footnote">This "scalp incident," as it came to be known, and as I may remark in passing,
became the probably groundless pretext for a storm of abuse of British
methods of warfare. In the feverish state of public opinion which the startling
climax of the battle of York excited almost to frenzy, it was regarded as
adding insult to injury, and furthermore taken as a proof that our dead and
wounded would be handed over by the British to their Indian allies, to be dealt
with according to the customs of savage warfare. Thus, the usually temperate
and judicious editor of the Register could permit himself to say: "The '<i>mace</i>'
is the emblem of authority, and the <i>scalp's</i> position near it is truly symbolical of
the <i>British</i> power in <i>Canada</i>. Horrible and infamous wretches! But the
reign of the murderers is nearly at an end," p. 190. And again, p. 259, with
"scalp" in large capitals, and various other typographical methods of relieving
his state of mind: "<span class="smcap">British humanity</span>. When major-general <i>Dearborn</i>
stated that a SCALP had been found in the <i>government-house of Upper Canada</i>,
suspended near the mace, the emblem of power, many persons affected to
doubt the fact; but most men believed, not only because General Dearborn had
stated the circumstance, but because it was strictly characteristic of the <i>British</i>
government, which is as base and deliberately wicked as any other in the civilized
world. But the horrible fact is further and conclusively established by
commodore <i>Chauncey</i>, whose testimony will not be disputed, openly, by those
who <i>pretended</i> to disbelieve gen. Dearborn. Let us hear no more of '<i>British
humanity</i> and <i>religion</i>'&mdash;nor permit these great attributes to be lavished upon
murderous villains. It is fact, horrible fact, that the legislature of '<i>unoffending
Canada</i>' did sanction (by hanging up in their hall, in evidence of their
authority, a <i>human scalp</i>) the murders of our people by the savages. Great
Heaven!" This senseless outburst concludes with the following letter:</p>

<p class="footnotel25">
<i>U.Â S. Ship Madison, Sackett's Harbor, 4th June, 1813.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;I have the honor to present to you by the hands of lieutenant Dudley, the

<i>parliament house</i> by one of my officers and presented to me. The scalp I
caused to be presented to general Dearborn, who I believe still has it in his
possession. I also send by the same gentleman, one of the British flags taken
at Fort George on the 27th of May.</p>

<p class="footnote">It may be here added that the practice of scalping is by no means confined to
the aborigines of North America. Among white Americans, it has never been
too uncommon to excite remark, still less reprobation; and though it may not
have been a regularly recognized and practiced incident of our warfare with
Indians of late years, one has only to read any of the chronicles of our earlier
warrings with Indian, English, or French foes, to perceive the entire reciprocity
of the custom. It fell into desuetude, on our part, less from any disrepute
than from sheer indifference. Instances are not lacking during the last
century, of our skinning whole Indians, tanning their hides, and manufacturing
the leather into various articles of use or joy; and when we ceased to scalp
as a rule, it was simply because scalps were no longer worth the trouble of
taking. I am myself no stranger to reeking Apache scalps, taken both by citizens
and soldiery. I knew a young officer of our army who, in a spirit of
bravado, fastened an Apache scalp to each of his spurs, and wore them with the
long black hair trailing at his heels during one of his hunts for Indians in
Arizona. The legislature of one of our Territories passed a bill offering a
reward of a certain sum of money for every "buck" Indian's scalp which should
be produced, and a certain other sum for the scalp of "anything in the shape
of an Indian," <i>i. e.</i>, woman or child. The British general, Henry Hamilton,
while lieutenant-governor at Detroit, had a regular tariff of prices both for
prisoners and for scalps which he purchased from Indians and from white renegades,
thus acquiring the soubriquet of "the hair-buying general," applied to
him by George Rogers Clark. Honors are so easy on this score that they do
not count in the game of war which the British played with their American
cousins.</p>

magazine was stigmatized in phrases current at a time when invective was invoked
till language was exhausted. In the cooling of overheated passions a sense of
humor stole in to the relief of surcharged feelings, and execration of the shocking
catastrophe subsided from the sublime to the ridiculous. "And it was not
until after the capture of Fort George," says Whiting, p. 306, "that this explosion
ceased to haunt, like a dreadful spectre, the American army. While preparing
for that capture, it seemed to be a settled conviction in the mind of the
commander-in-chief, that explosions were to be the ordinary means of warfare
with the British. On the point opposite Fort Niagara, and not far from Fort
George, stood a lighthouse, which was made of stone. The common impression
was, that these stones were to be discharged upon our heads whenever we made
the attempt to land; it being taken for granted that we should land between
that and a neighboring wood, as the open grounds there were completely commanded
by the guns of our fort. Many British deserters came over during the
month which elapsed between the capture of York and Fort George. The
question asked of each was, whether the lighthouse were <i>mined</i>. No answer
intimated that it was; still it was determined to land at a safe distance from it,
though the point chosen afforded the enemy an excellent cover, where his
batteries could be silenced only by our vessels. After the landing had been
effected, the lighthouse was approached by stragglers with much caution, until
some one, more hardy or more curious than the rest, entering into it, found
within its recesses, instead of a Guy Fawkes, some women and children, who
had taken shelter there from the dangers of the day."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-3" id="Footnote_I-3" href="#FNanchor_I-3"><span class="label">[I-3]</span></a> In undertaking to follow a traveler, the first thing to ascertain is his "personal
equation"&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the probable error of his mileages. Pike traveled entirely
by his watch, and all his distances are guesses based upon rate of progress&mdash;so
many hours, so many miles. The way to approximate accuracy in this
matter is to take him between two fixed points whose actual distance apart is
ascertained, see what he makes of this, and adjust him accordingly. From St.
Louis to Keokuk, by the present usual steamboat channel of the Miss. r., is
202Â¼ m.; say to the foot of Des Moines rapids, roundly 200 m. Pike's figures,
as nearly as these can be got at, make this distance about 250 m. Hence
we must discount his mileages 20 per cent., or one-fifth, as a rule. Taking one
thing with another&mdash;changes in the channel in the course of the century, good
or bad water, Pike's own feelings, errors of manuscript or print, etc., we shall
find this deduction to work well; with the aid of such topographical data as we
have, it will enable us to set most of his camps pretty closely. On the 10th,
Pike gets left to bivouac on the bank at a point in Jersey Co., Ill., opposite
Portage des Sioux, Mo., his barge being storm-bound somewhere above Alton,
Ill., perhaps in the vicinity of Clifton or Randolph. The distance between
Alton, first notable point above the Mo. r., and Grafton, last notable point below
the Illinois r., is 16 m. Besides Alton and Clifton, places passed on the N.
side are Shields' branch, Hop Hollow, Falling Rock cr., and Piasa cr.&mdash;some of
the present isls. above Mobile isl. are Maple, Ellis, Search's, Piasa, and Eagle's
Nest&mdash;the latter off Portage des Sioux.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-4" id="Footnote_I-4" href="#FNanchor_I-4"><span class="label">[I-4]</span></a> Portage des Sioux (or de Sioux) is that place in St. Charles Co., Mo., where
the Mo. r. comes nearest to the Miss. r. before their confluence. It was the
site of an early settlement on the S. bank of the Miss. r., one FranÃ§ois Saucier
having first built on the spot, 1769 or 1770; the village was already there
in Pike's time, and still perpetuates the old F. name of the hostile Sioux's crossing-place
(<i>ca.</i> 1780) between the two great rivers, also called Sioux Portage or
Portage of the Sioux: see Beck's Gaz.; or Wetmore's, p. 254.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-5" id="Footnote_I-5" href="#FNanchor_I-5"><span class="label">[I-5]</span></a> First great tributary of the Miss. r. above the Mo. r., falling in at Calhoun
pt., Calhoun Co., Ill., opp. Camden, Jersey Co., Ill.; Mason's isl. the largest
one of several more in the Miss. r. just below the mouth of the Ill. r. In coming
S. the Miss. r. makes a great bend E. and then nearly N. to the confluence,
whence it turns again to a course approx. coincident with that which the Ill. r.
holds; hence Pike's remark that the one might be mistaken for a part of the
other. The river has had many names; the present is in form a French plural,
<i>sc.</i> RiviÃ¨re des Illinois, <i>sc.</i> of the people who lived on it&mdash;Illin, Illini, Illinoct,
Illinoac, Illinoet, Illiniwek, Illeni, Illenois, Ilinois, Islinois, Islenois, etc.
Pike's map has Illenois; Franquelin's, 1688, R. des Ilinois. Another aboriginal
name, Theakiki, Teakiki, etc., whence Kankakee, was applied to one of
the branches of this river. The Ill. r. sometimes shared the name St. Louis
with the Mississippi and the Ohio. It was called R. de Seignelay by Hennepin,
in compliment to the marquis of that name; and once known as the Divine r.
The importance of this river as a water-way from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi
is second only to that of the Wisconsin, and would be first if the long
projected connection of St. Louis with Chicago by water were made. The use
of these two rivers for this purpose was originally almost simultaneous; for
Joliet and Marquette reached the Miss. r. from Green bay by the Wisc. r. June
15th or 17th, 1673, came down the Miss. r. past the mouth of the Ill. r. in July
that year, continued down to or near the Arkansaw, turned up the Miss. r. July
17th, reached the Ill. r., and went up the latter to L. Michigan, Aug.-Sept.,
1673. One of Joliet's maps, 1674, clearly shows the Wis. r. and Ill. r. connections
of the Miss. r. with L. Michigan and Green bay respectively. Michael
Accault's party, consisting of himself, Antoine Auguelle, and L. Hennepin,
dispatched by La Salle from Fort CrÃªvec&oelig;ur on the Ill. r., Feb. 29th, 1680,
reached its mouth Mar. 7th, 1680; La Salle did the same himself Feb. 6th,
1682. The latter&mdash;one of the very greatest men in the early history of American
discovery and exploration&mdash;came upon the Ill. r. in Dec., 1679, and made
the first French establishment on Lower Mississippian waters in Jan., 1680, at
the Illinois village Pimetoui, close to present Peoria.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-6" id="Footnote_I-6" href="#FNanchor_I-6"><span class="label">[I-6]</span></a> Among the islands (or their modern representatives) past which Pike struggled
may be named Perry, Squaw, Enterprise, and Iowa; the present channel
is W. of all these excepting Squaw, taking through Hatchet chute to Rock ldg.
and Milan, Calhoun Co., Ill. That island whose foot is now nearest 6 m. from
the Illinois r. is Dardenne; but camp was more probably a mile short of this,
where is now Bolter's isl., as it is called&mdash;properly Boulder's.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-7" id="Footnote_I-7" href="#FNanchor_I-7"><span class="label">[I-7]</span></a> About 21 m., Bolter's isl. to the Four Brothers, at Cap au GrÃ¨s. The present
run of the principal islands is: Dardenne, Two Branch, Criminal, Peruque,
Sweden, all below the mouth of Buffalo, Copper or Cuivre r. Dardenne cr.
falls in on the left hand going up, right bank, opp. the island of that name; it
appears as Dardonne on Owen's map. Peruque cr. occupies a corresponding
position opp. Peruque and Sweden isls.; Nicollet's map has Perruque. R.
au Cuivre or aux B&oelig;ufs of the French, Copper and Buffalo r. of others
("Quiver" r. of Lewis and Clark's map, 1814), is a large stream which
courses from Montgomery into Lincoln Co., Mo., and then, with its Big cr.
branch, separates the latter from St. Charles Co.; it falls into Cuivre slough,
which cuts off Cuivre isl., 3 m. long. At the upper end of this slough is
the mouth of the creek mapped by Nicollet as M<sup>c</sup>Lean's, now as Bob, Bobb,
Bobs, Bobbs, etc., cr. Some of the named places along the river are Brock's,
Dixon's, Fruitland, Thomason's, Beck's, Two Branch, Martin's, Hastings,
Beech's, and Bogtown&mdash;all insignificant, mostly mere landings, and all in Calhoun
Co., Ill., excepting Beck's. Pike's Four Brothers are represented by
islands Nos. 499, 500, 501, and 502, of late surveys, not now abreast; all are
small, and the largest one is called Sarah Ann. Pike's "beautiful cedar cliff"
is Cap au GrÃ¨s rock, opposite a hamlet of the same name in Lincoln Co., Mo.;
Dogtown, Ill., is under the cliff. The phrase is commonly rendered Cap au
Gre or Cap au Gris, by mistaking F. grÃ¨s, a noun, meaning sandstone, for F.
<i>gris</i>, adj., gray. Long of 1817, as pub. 1860 and again 1890, has a Little Cape
Gris; Beltrami, II. p. 196, renders Great Cape Gray. The exact distance to
this place from Grafton is 27 m.; from Alton, 43 m.; from St. Louis 66 m.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-8" id="Footnote_I-8" href="#FNanchor_I-8"><span class="label">[I-8]</span></a> Cap au GrÃ¨s to Hamburg, Calhoun Co., Ill., 22 m.; river crooked, and
channel still more so; late start and much obstruction; Pike may hardly have
reached Hamburg, but was in that vicinity, and we may set him there, in the
absence of any datum for greater precision. The "vast" number of islands he
passed have their modern representatives in such as: Sandy, 2Â½ m. long, with
Turner's near it; Stag and Maple, abreast; Sterling; Westport, 3Â½ m. long,
with Kickapoo and Kelly's alongside it. Along this whole way, on the left
hand going up, in Lincoln Co., Mo., runs a long slough approx. parallel with
the river. This is the discharge of Bryant's cr., which approaches the river
opp. Hamburg, gets from the hills and runs in the bottom down to Sandy isl.;
it is called Bayou au Roi on some maps, Bayou Roy on others. Nicollet charts
it with his usual accuracy, but without name. The principal places passed are
the villages of Sterling and Westport, Lincoln Co., Mo.; Gilead, back up on
the hill, in Calhoun Co., Ill.; lesser ones are the landings, wood-piles, or what-not,
called Asbury, Turner's, Hogtown, and Red's. The St. L., Keok. and
N. W. R. R. runs in the bottom along the bayou; stations Foley, Apex, Elsberry,
and Dameron.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-9" id="Footnote_I-9" href="#FNanchor_I-9"><span class="label">[I-9]</span></a> <i>Polyodon spatula</i>, or <i>Spatularia spatula</i>, the paddlefish, also called spoon-billed
cat or duck-billed cat, common in Mississippian waters. It sometimes
attains a length of 5 or 6 feet; the shape resembles that of the sturgeon, but
the skin is scaleless, like a cat's. One of the Relations ascribed to Hennepin,
and pub. 1697, speaks of this fish as the "long-beaked sturgeon," and says it
was spawning Apr. 24th. Hennepin doubtless became acquainted with it when
he was first on the Mississippi, under Accault, in 1680: see, <i>e. g.</i>, Shea's Tr.
of Henp., 1880, p. 359.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-11" id="Footnote_I-11" href="#FNanchor_I-11"><span class="label">[I-11]</span></a> From Hamburg to Clarksville is 14Â½ m., Louisiana or Louisianaville, 24Â½;
Pike went about 20, say to Krider's bend, and his camp was on an island which
we may take to be that now called Krider's, 6 m. above Clarksville, 4 m. below
Louisiana. The "continuation of islands" is now the following in ascending
series, omitting about a dozen small ones; Mosier's or Mozier's, and Howard's,
together, the former 1Â¾ m. long; Tilden's; McCoy's or Cock; Slim and
Grimes, the former 3Â¼ m. long; Coon, 1 m.; Carroll's or Carle's, 1Â¾; Amaranth,
small; Eagle, 1 m.; Clarksville, 2 m., opposite the town; Pharr's, 1Â¾ m.;
and Krider's, 1 m. Above Mosier's isl. and ldg., on the E., is the outlet of
Hamburg bay, 3Â½ m. above the town; Bay cr. falls into it. Behind Slim isl.
is the chute of that name, into which falls the large creek called Guin's, Guinn's,
Gwin's, etc.; and at the head of the island is the mouth of Ramsey's cr.,
another large one. These streams are both in Pike Co., Mo.; and as soon as
Pike passes opposite Clarksville he has Pike Co., Ill., on his right, so that he
sails many miles with a county of his own on each side. Clarksville, Mo., is
something of a town, on the edge of the river, under the hill around which
Calumet cr. comes to fall in just above; and 3 m. higher comes Little Calumet
cr. on the same side. Opposite Clarksville is the lower opening of that immense
slough whose character is not less remarkable than its name. This runs
for more than 30 m. alongside the river, clear through Pike Co., Ill., and into
Adams Co., forming a maze of channels which intersect one another and thus
cut off various islands, besides opening into the Mississippi at several places;
some of these lesser sloughs are called Spring Lake, Atlas, Cocklebur, Swift,
Coon, Mud, Five Points, Crooked, Running, and Swan. This collateral water-course
also receives a series of creeks, among which are those called Big or Big
Stew, Six Mile, Honey or Hadley, Ashton or Fall, and Harkness. This whole
affair is commonly called the Snicarty or Sny Carte; it is Suycartee Slough on
Owen's map, and has other variants too numerous to recount. All these words
or phrases are perversions of F. Chenal ÃcartÃ©, lit. cut-off channel. For this
and the corresponding formation of the name Sniabar or Snibar, given to a
creek and town in Missouri, see my note, N. Y. Nation, Jan. 19th, 1893, and
Lewis and Clark, ed. 1893, p. 29. The embankment built to defend the
river from the slough is known as the Sny levee.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-12" id="Footnote_I-12" href="#FNanchor_I-12"><span class="label">[I-12]</span></a> About 20 m., setting Pike in the vicinity of Cincinnati, Pike Co., Ill.;
camp perhaps a little beyond this town, but just about opposite the boundary
between Pike Co., Mo., and Ralls Co., Mo. On the Illinois side we have nothing
worthy of note but the snaky Snicarty, back of which are the villages Atlas
and Rockport. But the Missouri side offers some interesting things. On decamping
from Krider's isl., Pike passes in quick succession two creeks, Louisiana and
Salt river, all on his left, all within 6 m. 1. Pike elsewhere cites both these creeks,
and says the first of them is the one he calls Bar r.; this is now Buffalo
cr., falling in 2 m. below Louisiana; the bar at its mouth, whence the name,
is present Buffalo isl. 2. The next creek is that immediately above, whose
mouth is Louisiana; this is called Noir cr. on most of the maps before me, but
Bear cr. on the latest G. L. O. map; which name the natives prefer I am not
informed. 3. Louisiana is quite a town, which dates back to Nicollet's time,
at least, as he marks it on the beautiful map he made before 1840. The Chic.
and Alton R. R. bridges the river at the mouth of Noir or Bear cr. This
was built 1872-73 (Act of Congr., Mar. 3d, 1871); the town or station Pike is on
the Illinois side, opp. Louisiana. The C. B. and Q. R. R. sends a branch
here; the St. L., Keok. and N. W. R. R. also runs through Louisiana. 4.
Next is Salt r., which Pike elsewhere calls Oahahah, and others Auhaha, 2 m.
above Louisiana. This seems to have been known long before the time Pike's
remark would suggest; if I mistake not, it is laid down on some maps before
1700. It is a large river; the French were along here in 1680-90, and I
can put my finger on an old F. RiviÃ¨re au Sel. Salt r., with its branches, is
big enough to water five or six modern counties, before it falls in through Pike
Co. Present islands in Pike's course of to-day, from Salt r. upward, are
Angle, South, and North Fritz between Hickory chute and Scott's ldg., Atlas,
Blackbird, and Denmark, between a couple of Snicarty openings and Mundy's
ldg. or Ashburn sta.; then the very large Gilbert's isl., 2Â½ m. long, which lies
between Gilbert's and Tompkins' ldg. on the Missouri side, and Cincinnati ldg.
on the other. A good deal of engineering work was done at this bad place to
close Gilbert's chute and throw the main channel over against the Illinois side.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-13" id="Footnote_I-13" href="#FNanchor_I-13"><span class="label">[I-13]</span></a> Cincinnati Landing, Pike Co., Ill., to Hannibal, Marion Co., Mo., 12 m.
direct, and not much more by river, as its course is quite straight. The Frenchman's
house, 4 m. beyond which Pike went to camp, was a germ of Hannibal,
sown under the handsome hill, just above a little run which Nicollet and Owen
both map as Bear cr., opposite Hurricane isl. This place is mapped by Pike
as Hurricane Settlement; he speaks of it again under date of Apr. 26th, 1806.
It is now a notable railroad center; the Wabash R. R. built the bridge in 1871
(Act of Congr., July 25th, 1866). On the Illinois side there was a place called
Douglasville, which seems to have been a forerunner of the town or station
Shepherd; while Hannibal itself has also the St. L., Keok. and N. W. R. R.
skirting the Miss. r., the Hann. and St. Jo., the St. L. and Hann., and
the Mo., Kas. and Tex. To reach this then French embryo, Pike
proceeded with present Pike Co., Ill., on his right the whole way, but with
Ralls Co. on his left, to past Saverton in the latter county, and so on to
Marion Co., Mo. He passed the positions of the islands now called Taylor's,
Cottel's, King's, and Glasscock's; and after he had interviewed the Frenchman he
went on past the present position of the mouth of Bayou St. Charles, off which
are Turtle, Glaucus, and other islands, to camp in Marion Co., Mo., about
where the present boundary between Pike and Adams cos., Ill., strikes the
river&mdash;that is to say, opposite Armstrong isl., near the beginning of the Snicarty.
The St. Charles or Charles is old in history; I have seen the name ascribed to
Hennepin, 1680, but have not myself so found it. Pike's Hurricane isl. is
probably not now determinable, if existent, unless he means a large tract of
bottom-land opposite Hannibal, isolated by the Snicarty. Glasscock's isl. is now
or was lately the only well-founded island on the river near the mouth of Bear
cr. It is said in Holcombe's Hist. Marion Co., 1884, p. 902, that an island
opposite the mouth of Bear cr. disappeared in 1849. Judge Thos. W. Bacon,
who came to Hannibal in 1847, informs me <i>in lit.</i> Mar. 21st, 1894, that he
remembers no such island; "there was a sand-bar visible at low water just
above the mouth of Bear cr., and it disappeared long ago, but no such
fugitive formation could properly be termed an island. Along the N. front of
the site of Hannibal was once an incipient island&mdash;a sand-bar with growing
willows extending from the N. end almost to the mainland. This gradually
disappeared except at the lower end, where it prolonged and merged into a
granite gravel bed or bar visible at low water, which was dredged away by the
government." Pike is probably mistaken in using the name Hurricane in
the present connection. There were a Hurricane ldg., isl., and cr. lower
down, in Lincoln Co.; but Judge Bacon informs me he never heard the name
applied to Hannibal. Nor is it true that this town was ever called Stavely's
ldg., except as a piece of fugitive sarcasm in the newspapers of a rival town,
arising in the habit of one John W. Stavely, a saddler of Hannibal, who used to
haunt the landing when steamers arrived. It could not well have been first
known as a "landing," because the first steamer to arrive there, the Gen.
Putnam, Moses D. Bates, master, came in 1825, while Hannibal was platted in
1819 by its present name, shortly after Pike Co. was organized (Dec. 14th, 1818).
The classical term is said to be traceable to Antoine Soulard, surveyor-general,
who is also said to have named Fabius r. for the great Roman cunctator. But
this is dubious; old forms Fabas and Fabbas suggest Sp. <i>fabas</i> beans. Bay St.
Charles was called Scipio r., as attested by the hamlet of Port Scipio at its mouth.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-14" id="Footnote_I-14" href="#FNanchor_I-14"><span class="label">[I-14]</span></a> This stretch of "39" m. needs to be warily discussed. The whole distance
from Hannibal to Keokuk by the river channel is only 61 m. Pike
makes it from his camp of the 16th to that of the 19th 39 + 23 + 4 = 76 m.;
he also started from a little above Hannibal on the 17th, and did not quite
make Keokuk on the 19th; for he only got to the foot of the Des Moines rapids
after breakfast on the 20th. The whole way would have been about 80 of
his miles against say 60 of actual travel, or the proportion of 4:3, as already
noted, <a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>; and we may confidently set him down on the 17th halfway
between Hannibal and Keokuk. Now from Hannibal to La Grange is 30
m. and from La Grange to Keokuk is 31 m.; La Grange, Lewis Co., Mo.,
at the mouth of Wyaconda r., is the required location of camp of the 17th.
This is 10 m. above Quincy, the seat of Adams Co., Ill., one of the best known
cities on the river, though not as old as some of them. The C. B. and Q.
R. R. bridged the river just above the city in 1867-68; a West Quincy grew up
on the Missouri side, and the present importance of the place requires no comment.
A very short distance above Quincy Pike passes from Marion into
Lewis Co., Mo. But the most important point of this day's voyage is one
to which the above text does not even allude. Pike elsewhere speaks of a
certain Jaustioni river, as the then boundary between the U.Â S. and the Sac
nation, 7 m. above the Frenchman's house at Hurricane Settlement, on the
W. side; and he traces this river on his  map by the name Jauflione. Now
there are five large streams which enter the Miss. r. on the W. within 3 m. of
one another, by four separate mouths, in Marion Co., say 2 to 5 miles below
W. Quincy, and the proportionate distance above Hannibal. They are
now known as (1) South Two Rivers; (2) North Two Rivers; (3) a branch
of the latter&mdash;these three emptying practically together, just below Fabius
isl.; (4) South Fabius; and (5) North Fabius rivers, which fall into
a slough whose two mouths are opposite Orton's isl. Pike has left us
no data to decide which of these he means by Jaustioni or Jauflione,
especially as the positions of the several outlets have no doubt changed
since 1805. They are all at present, or were very recently, considerably
more than the "seven" miles above Hannibal, being entirely beyond the
Bayou St. Charles, itself about 7 m. long. Pike's queer names, Justioni
or Jaustioni, and Jauflione (latter in early text, 1807, p. 4, and on map), are
found also as Jeffreon, and usually as Jeffrion. Some form of the name, the
meaning of which I have never learned, endured for many years; thus Jauflione
r. appears in Morse's Univ. Gaz., 3d ed. 1821, p. 350, though it had mostly
disappeared from ordinary maps of about that date. The river thus designated
has a history which will bear looking up. Judge Thos. H. Bacon of Hannibal
refers me to certain documents bearing on French Colonial history to
be found in Amer. State Papers, VI. 1860, pp. 713-14, and 830-34, also
repub. in Holcombe's Hist. Marion Co., 1884. On p. 834 is: "July 10th, 1810.
Board met. Present John B. C. Lucas, Clement B. Penrose, and Frederick
Bates, Commissioners. Charles Gratiot, assignee of Mathurin Bouvet, claiming
84 arpents of land front on the Mississippi river and in depth from the river
back to the hills in the district of St. Charles.... The Board order that this
claim be surveyed, provided that it be not situated above the mouth of the
River Jeffrion conformably to the possession of Mathurin Bouvet," etc. As
Bouvet's claim was ultimately confirmed to Gratiot, Jeffrion r. must have been
above Salt r. The next considerable river above Salt r. is that one of the
"Two Rivers" called South r.; but this is hardly 30 m. long, and an Act of
Dec. 31st, 1813, describes Jeffrion r. as over 30 m. long. The next one is North
Two Rivers; undoubtedly it is this one which was known as the Jeffrion in
Territorial days. When the region was first settled it was called the Two
Rivers country, and the title of a certain Two Rivers Baptist Association preserves
this designation. The Governor of Louisiana Territory was required
to divide it into districts (Act of Congr., Mar. 26th, 1804, sec. 13); Holcombe's
Hist. Marion Co., p. 37, says that Governor Wm. Clark by proclamation reorganized
the districts into counties Oct. 1st, 1812; and doubtless the Jeffrion
would be there again in mention. Bouvet's settlement on Bay Charles is
unquestionable in location; it was described as about 34 leagues above St.
Louis, and was a place with which the commissioners must have been officially
acquainted. In history B. Charles is nearly a century older than St. Louis, and
it was for many years a better known locality. Present North r. is the only
one that answers the historical and geographical requirements of the north one
of Two Rivers of early Territorial times and of the Jeffrion r. of French
Colonial days. Holcombe, p. 148, gives an account of Kentucky prospectors
on the Jeffrion in 1817. The name of the Sac chief Black Hawk occurs in connection
with an incident on Two Rivers in 1812. But the most satisfactory
and in fact a conclusive identification of North Two Rivers with the Jauflione is
derivable from the terms of our treaty with the Sacs and Foxes of 1804. This
will be found in Statutes at Large, VII. p. 84, <i>seq.</i>: A Treaty between the
United States of America and the United Tribes of Sac and Fox Indians,
made Nov. 3d, 1804, ratified Jan. 25th, 1805, and proclaimed Feb. 21st, 1805.
Among the "articles of a treaty made at St. Louis in the district of Louisiana
between William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana territory and of the
district of Louisiana [etc., etc.] of the one part, and the chiefs and head men
of the united Sac and Fox tribes of the other part," there is one defining the
boundary thus: "<span class="smcap">Article 2.</span> The general boundary or line between the
lands of the United States and of the said Indian tribes shall be as follows, to
wit: Beginning at a point on the Missouri river opposite to the mouth of the
Gasconade river; thence in a direct course so as to strike the river Jeffreon at the
distance of thirty miles from its mouth, and down the said Jeffreon to the Mississippi,"
etc., etc. In company with Mr. Robert F. Thompson of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs at Washington I made a special examination of maps in his
office with reference to this point, and among them found one, prepared for
office use in determining boundaries indicated in the terms of Indian treaties, on
which the boundary in mention had been drawn from the Missouri opposite the
mouth of the Gasconade directly to a point supposed to be 30 m. up the
<i>North</i> Two Rivers, which I had on other grounds determined the Jauflione
or Jeffreon to be. This river empties in Fabius township, in the N. W. Â¼ of
Sect. 3, T. 58 N., R. 5 W., Marion Co., Mo.</p>

<p class="footnote">On this extraordinary cession see a note by L. C. D[raper] in Minn. Hist.
Coll., III. Part 2, p. 143, 1874.</p>

<p class="footnote">At the upper end of St. Charles bayou, called Bayou chute, a couple of
miles below Two Rivers, was the site of a place that rejoiced on paper in the
name of Marion City. They started a railroad there, were liable to wash-outs,
and inspired Charles Dickens' idea of his quizzical "Eden." If one would like
to see how uncounted "cities" were laid out in gaudy prints&mdash;some consisting in
a hovel or two, some without even that&mdash;let him look over Featherstonhaugh's
diverting relations of the '30's, when he traveled in these parts, then overrun
with a set of the neediest, greediest, and most unscrupulous landsharks that
ever lived on calomel, whisky, and the gullibility of their fellows. Marion City
is located on one of the maps before me, but not on any of the others. A
little above it are Fabius and Orton isls., already mentioned, and opposite
these is Ward's isl., larger than either of the other two. A couple of miles
above Quincy begins the group of Cottonwood isls., opposite a large horseshoe-shaped
slough which seems to be an old cut-off of the river; it is connected
with the Fabius r. outlets, and receives Durgan's (<i>i. e.</i>, Durkee's) cr. At
Quincy is the lower outlet of a very extensive snicarty, 12 or 15 m. direct,
and much more by its sinuosities; this begins at Canton (above La Grange) and
connects at various points with Canton chute, itself some 10 m. long. La
Grange, where Pike camps, was so called from the hill under which it nestled,
and the English of which would be Barn hill. The original settlement was
named Wyaconda or Waconda, from the river at whose mouth it was made;
thus Nicollet's map marks Wiyakonda instead of La Grange, preserving the
Indian name of the place. This river is a large one which, with its branches,
traverses Scotland and Clark cos. before entering Lewis Co. Before settlement
a certain tract of country below La Grange had been called Waconda prairie,
or in some similar form of the Indian word, as Wacondaw of Maj. Thos.
Forsyth, 1819; and this is what Pike's map presents as the "Small Prairie."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-15" id="Footnote_I-15" href="#FNanchor_I-15"><span class="label">[I-15]</span></a> About two-thirds of the way from La Grange to Keokuk&mdash;say to Fox
prairie, at the mouth of Fox r., site of Gregory's Landing, Clark Co., Mo.
The principal place passed is Canton, Lewis Co., Mo., 7 m. above La Grange,
opposite the head of Canton chute. Some other places that were started, such as
Satterfield, would be hard to find on a latter-day map. Tully is now practically
a part of Canton; Tully isl. exists, 3 or 4 m. above Canton, and Satterfield's
creek is a branch of Fox r. Near there, one Dodd kept for some years a
woodyard on the Illinois side, and the steamboat channel among the sand-bars
and islands in his vicinity acquired the name of Dodd's crossing.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-16" id="Footnote_I-16" href="#FNanchor_I-16"><span class="label">[I-16]</span></a> About 10 m., from Gregory's ldg. to "the point of a beach" within the
present city limits of Keokuk, Lee Co., Ia., immediately above the mouth
of Des Moines r., which for some distance separates the States of Missouri
and Iowa; opposite is Hancock Co., Ill. The place where Pike got sawyered
was very likely between Hackley's and Fox isls. The place is a bad one;
there has been a good deal of engineering work done in damming Hackley's
chute, and jettying the channel over to the other side. Fox r. (once called
R. Puante, whence also Stinking cr.) is not mentioned by Pike in the present
connection; but he speaks of it elsewhere, and lays it down on his map without
name, marking an Indian village on the Illinois side between its mouth and
that of Des Moines r. The present or a very recent arrangement of its discharge
is by Fox slough, a small snicarty that begins at Alexandria and runs 5
m. down to Gregory's ldg. This cuts off a piece of bottom which the railroad
traverses between the points said, besides Fox and several lesser islands.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-17" id="Footnote_I-17" href="#FNanchor_I-17"><span class="label">[I-17]</span></a> For the origin of this name, involving a spurious etymology by association
with Trappist monks, see Lewis and Clark, ed. 1893, p. 20. The always careful
and accurate Nicollet made the matter quite plain: see his Rep. 1843,
p. 22. Some form of the old Indian name is used by the earliest French
travelers in these parts. One of the oldest maps I have seen, dressÃ©e par J. B.
Franquelin dans 1688 pour Ãªtre presentÃ©e Ã  Louis XIV., letters R. des Moingana,
and marks the Indian village of Moingoana. One of Joliet's maps has
Moeng8ena. Joliet and Marquette passed its mouth going down the Miss. r. in
1673, on or about June 25th; Accault, Auguelle, and Hennepin passed it going
up the Miss. r. early in 1680. Besides the many early variants of the phrase
which settled into Des Moines, we find R. of the Outontantas, 8tantas, 8t8ntes,
Otentas, etc., R. of the Peouareas, Paotes, etc., R. of the Maskoutens, etc.,
Nadouessioux, etc. This is the largest river Pike has come to since he left the
Illinois, and the only tributary of the Missouri which he charts with any detail;
he lays it down with 20 of its branches, and marks the positions on it of old
Forts Crawford and St. Louis. We observe that he calls it De Moyen; and
this gives occasion for a blunder not less amusing than to call it Trappist r.
would be. For our hero was ambitious of French scholarship, and on consulting
his dictionary to find out about <i>moyen</i>, he set the stream down as <i>Means</i>
r. in his French-English vocabulary of geographical names. Another author,
or his printer, got it Demon r. Beltrami, 1828, renders Le Moine and
Monk r. Pike's editor of the early text, 1807, has des Moines, p. 4. The
stream is a large and very important one, too much so to be entered upon in
a mere note like this; but I may observe that it is historically less significant
than those of similar extent on the Illinois and Wisconsin side of the Mississippi,
because several of the latter were highways during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. The mouth of the Des Moines became of course
the scene of early settlement, but not all the places started there survived.
Nicollet's map shows three&mdash;Keokuck, Montebello, Warsaw. Owen's, somewhat
later, has also Nassau and Churchville, immediately at the debouchure,
where there came to be also a Buenavista. Publishing in 1847, but having
written of 1835, the always entertaining Featherstonhaugh speaks of "a sorry
settlement on the left bank, called Keokuk, after a celebrated Sauk chief,
inhabited altogether by a set of desperados"&mdash;a diagnosis which will no doubt
be better relished by the Hamiltonians, Varsovians, and Alexandrians than by the
present polished Keokukites. He should have made one exception, however,
for he found there the famous George Catlin, Nov. 4th, 1835: see his book, II.
p. 42. Besides Keokuk, Lee Co., Ia., at the foot of the rapids above the
mouth of the Des Moines, the three places which have grown into urban reality
are: Hamilton, Hancock Co., Ill., directly opposite Keokuk; Warsaw, Hancock
Co., Ill., 2 m. below the mouth, and directly opposite this, Alexandria,
Clark Co., Mo. Three States as well as three counties thus met here. Pike
continues with Illinois on his right, but now has Iowa instead of Missouri on
his left.</p>

<p class="footnote">Fort Edwards was a position of importance for some years. This military
post was built on the east side of the Mississippi, 3 m. below the foot of the
rapids, and directly opposite the two islands which divided the outlet of the
Des Moines into three channels. Half a mile S. W. from the fort was Cantonment
Davis, its precursor, abandoned when the works were completed. The
locality is practically Warsaw. A full description of this establishment, as it
was at the time of Long's visit in August, 1817, is given in his report, as
printed in Minn. Hist. Col., II. Part 1, 1860; 2d ed. 1890, pp. 77-80. It
had been building since June, 1816, and was not quite finished in 1817.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-18" id="Footnote_I-18" href="#FNanchor_I-18"><span class="label">[I-18]</span></a> Some light&mdash;at least that light in which he was regarded&mdash;is thrown on
Mr. Ewing by a letter before me from General James Wilkinson to General
Henry Dearborn, Secretary at War, dated St. Louis, Dec. 3d, 1805: "In a
former letter you have asked me who this Ewing was? I can give you no
further Information than that I found Him in a place, which He is utterly
unqualified to fill&mdash;He is I understand placed at the River Desmoin, to teach
the Indians the Arts of Agriculture, but has I believe given but a wretched
example&mdash;This is I think the Third visit he has made since my arrival to this
place, and I expect his disbursements which are supplied by Mr. Chouteau may
exceed expectation&mdash;He appears to be a young man of innocence, levity &amp;
simplicity&mdash;without experience or observation."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-19" id="Footnote_I-19" href="#FNanchor_I-19"><span class="label">[I-19]</span></a> The rapids named from their situation above the mouth of Des Moines r.
have also been known as the Lower rapids, in distinction from those higher
up about the mouth of Rock r. These formidable obstacles to navigation
have been overcome by modern engineering skill, but Pike's curt notice of the
channel is clearly recognizable. The river was bridged by the Wabash road
between Hamilton and Keokuk, in 1869-70 (Act of Congr., July 25th, 1866); the
town lock and chain are within a mile or so of the bridge. Then succeed the
English, Lamalee, and Spanish chains, and the Upper chain at the head of the
rapids. The distance is about 11 m. Sandusky, Ia., was located between
the English and Lamalee chains; Nashville, Ia., at the Spanish chain; Solferino,
Ia., above the last; at or near one of these last two is Galland, Ia.; and
on the Illinois side is a place called Sonora. On that side Cheney cr. falls in at
Hamilton, and higher up are two others, known as Golden's and Quarry Sugar,
but which used to be called Wagoner's and Larry's; while on the Iowan side
Price's cr. falls in at the middle lock, Lamalee's at Sandusky, and several
smaller ones at various points. The railroad and canal hug the Iowan side. At
the head of the rapids the river makes a sharp bend; in the concavity of this
bend stands Nauvoo, Ill., originally a Mormon settlement; it used to be called
also Commerce. This is the place where Mr. Ewing had his establishment
when he entertained Pike; the latter charts it as "U.Â S. Agricultural Estab<sup>t</sup>."
The Sac village opposite was on the site of the present town of Montrose, Ia.
A large creek runs through this town. There are some islands at the head
of the rapids, between Nauvoo and Montrose, one of which, No. 401 of the
Miss. Surv. chart, is called Montrose. At the head of the bend, still opp. Nauvoo,
is the lower end of Dobson's slough, which receives a stream charted by
Nicollet and Owen as Sugar cr., but later dedicated to his Satanic majesty
by the name of Devil's or Big Devil cr., called by Beltrami Manitou cr. Devil's
isl. is the name of the large tract, nearly 4 m. long, which is isolated by Dobson's
slough, certain sections of which latter are known as Big River and Potter's.</p>

App. to Pt. 1. of the orig. ed. of this work. Pike's 5 or 6 m. takes him
past Dobson's slough and Devil's or Sugar cr. and isl., and the sand-bar on
which he camped is now represented by Niota isl., 2Â½ m. long, or one of
the small ones close by. The locality is the well-known one of the city of
Madison, or Fort Madison, seat of Lee Co., Ia. Opposite this city, in Hancock
Co., Ill., are two little places, one called Niota, and the other Appannose (Nicollet),
Appanoose (G. L. O. map), Appanooce (Miss. Surv. chart), etc. A certain
creek which falls in by Niota and is known as Tyson's cr. seems to be the
never-identified one which Lewis and Clark mapped in 1814 as Sand Bank cr.</p>

<p class="footnote">A history of Lee Co., pub. Chicago, 1879, says that the city of Fort Madison
was so called from the old fort and trading-post of that name. The author
speaks of the tradition that this establishment was built by Zachary Taylor,
when this distinguished general, afterward president of the United States, was
a lieutenant in the army; and attempts to refute this tradition by an appeal to
the War Department for the facts in the case. But unluckily, the information
he derived from this source was erroneous; for the Hon. Geo. W. McCrary, then
secretary of war, told him that the adjutant-general of the army reported to
him (McCrary) that Fort Madison was erected by Pike in 1805. Whereas,
besides imperishable renown, Pike erected nothing in 1805 but his stockade on
Swan r., and various patriotic flag-poles. The difference between selecting or
recommending a site for a fort, and building one on that site, is obvious at sight.
But Pike did not even select or recommend this spot for a fort, the lowest one
of several which he did pick out being at Burlington: see <a href="#Footnote_I-21">next note</a>. Z. Taylor
was a 1st lieut. of the 7th Infantry in 1808, appointed from Ky.; which
fact, as far as it goes, supports the tradition. The Andreas Hist. Atl. of Ia. has
it that the fort for which the town was named was built in 1808; evacuated and
burned by hostile Indians, 1813 (qu. 1812?). On Monday, Aug. 4th, 1817, when
Long visited the ruins of Fort Madison, there was nothing left but some old
chimneys, a covert way leading from the main garrison to some sort of an
elevated outwork in the rear, and a number of fruit-trees on the ground which
had been a garden: see Minn. Hist. Soc. II., Part 1, 1860, 2d ed. 1890, p. 75.
In the fall of 1832 one Peter Williams settled on the present site of the town.
The old trading-house there was called Le Moine factory. The old fort stood
close to the river, and as I judge within a third of a mile of the present State
penitentiary.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-21" id="Footnote_I-21" href="#FNanchor_I-21"><span class="label">[I-21]</span></a> About 18 m., to a position above the mouth of Skunk r., a little
below the Burlington bluffs; he calls it 5Â¼ m. to the locality he presently
describes with particularity, and which will be recognized as the site of Burlington,
seat of Des Moines Co., Ia. After passing Madison on his left, with
Niota and Appanoose on his right, he goes up by Pontoosuc and Dallas, both
in Hancock Co., Ill., and then has Henderson Co., Ill., on his right. Further
up, on the left, Lee Co. is separated from Des Moines Co., Ia., by Skunk r.
This is a large stream, whose present pleasant name translates the Indian
word rendered Shikagua by Nicollet, and Shokauk by Featherstonhaugh;
Lewis and Clark map it as Polecat r. Beltrami, 1828, calls it Polecat r.
and River of the BÃªte Puante. Green Bay is a small place in Lee Co., on
a sort of slough which discharges into the river behind Lead isl., and which
is called Green bay. This is connected in some way, which for me remains
occult, with a creek called by Nicollet Lost cr.; it is a part of the intricate waters
between Skunk r. and that stream which runs through Madison past the
State penitentiary, where the bridge that was built in 1887-88 strikes the Iowa
side. Jollyville was a place on the same waters, but seems to have been lost
like the creek. Some of the islands besides Lead, the present positions of
which Pike passed, if not these islands themselves, are now known as Dutchman,
Hog, Polk, Thompson, Peel, and Twin, the latter at the mouth of Skunk r.
His camp I suppose to have been about on the spot where one Sauerwein
used to keep his woodyard, about halfway between Twin isls. and the
mouth of Spruce (or Spring) cr. This is nearly opp. the middle of the great
island now called Burlington, formerly Big, being 7 m. long, separated from
the Illinois mainland by Shokokon slough, on which there is or was a place
called by this latter name. A number of creeks make into this slough, among
them those called Dug Out, Honey (Camp cr. of Nicollet and Owen), and
Ellison's. A place called Montreal started near Ellison's cr., but does not seem
to have survived. What Pike maps as "Sand bank Creek," at a place he
calls "Sand Bay," seems to be Dug Out cr., or the next one below, which falls
into the slough behind Thompson's isl., near Dallas City.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-22" id="Footnote_I-22" href="#FNanchor_I-22"><span class="label">[I-22]</span></a> This is the prairie through which meanders Henderson r., 6 m. above Burlington.
The Sac village was on its north bank. The prairie and the village
are lettered on the map as per text; the river is shown there, without name;
the Burlington bluffs are delineated, marked "Positions for a Fort." The
present city was built across the mouth of Hawkeye cr., a rivulet which makes
in above the steepest part of the bluff, where the Flint hills recede a little
from the river; it extends to the larger Flint cr. or r., at whose mouth it
may be said to be situated. Across the Mississippi is East Burlington, Ill., at
the head of Shokokon slough; the bridge which the C., B. and Q. R. R. built in
1867-68 spans the river and connects the two places. There are numerous
islands above Burlington, the principal of which are O'Connell's, Rush, and
Otter. Above Henderson r. there is nothing of special note till we reach
Oquawka, seat of Henderson Co., Ill., reckoned 13 m. by the channel above
Burlington. Pike omits his customary mileages to-day, but did not get beyond
Oquawka, which is at the head of the prairie on which he camped; for here
begin some steep banks, known before and since Pike's day as the Yellow banks.
He marks them on his map, and they are mentioned by the same name in Forsyth's
narrative of 1819.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-23" id="Footnote_I-23" href="#FNanchor_I-23"><span class="label">[I-23]</span></a> We are not told which side of the river this was, and the sentence is otherwise
ambiguous, as all streams hereabouts are branches of the river. We know
he means a bayou or slough, by following which he expected soon to regain the
Mississippi ahead of his boats, and I suppose that Huron slough, on the Iowa
side, led him astray. The slough itself is not long, merely cutting off Huron
and some smaller islands for four miles; but this receives Iowa slough, which
meanders toward the river, and so would take Pike and Bradley away from the
river if they followed it up. This supposition is strengthened by Pike's using
the word "savannah," which with him means rather marsh or bog than prairie,
and he would hardly have applied it to the better ground on the Illinois side
if he had gone there and been misled by Henderson r. Moreover, he continues
to camp on the west side, as he would naturally do after loss of the two
men who went to find his dogs; and also he expected to recover the men at the
place above where the hills first come down to the river, which is at Muscatine,
Ia. He does not say who these men were; they were not recovered till
Sept. 1st, at Dubuque.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-24" id="Footnote_I-24" href="#FNanchor_I-24"><span class="label">[I-24]</span></a> This mileage is excessive, as are all those hence to Rock Island or Davenport,
the distance of which by the channel is 70 m. from Oquawka, though
Pike makes it 92. Moreover, the distance from Oquawka to New Boston,
directly opposite the mouth of the Iowa r., is only 18 m., and Pike
remains below the Iowa r. to-day. What with sloughing it, losing his dogs,
and waiting for his men, he did not get much beyond Keithsburg, Mercer Co.,
Ill., which we may safely take as to-day's datum-point. This is built under a
bank at the mouth of Pope's cr., and so far answers the requirements of
Pike's camp opposite it. The situation is in Louisa Co., Ia., but a little distance
over the boundary of Des Moines Co. Excepting Keithsburg, no notable
point is passed to-day. A place called Huron was started on the slough of that
name, but it never came to anything. Huron isl. is called Thieves' isl. on some
maps. The large one (No. 355) opp. Keithsburg, and crossed by the railroad,
is separated from the Iowan side by Black Hawk slough.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-25" id="Footnote_I-25" href="#FNanchor_I-25"><span class="label">[I-25]</span></a> Pike delineates "Sand Bank" on his map directly opposite the mouth
of Iowa r. This is the site of New Boston, Mercer Co., Ill. The bank
comes immediately upon the river with a frontage of 2 m., and Edwards r.
falls in at the foot of the bank, 3Â½ m. above Pope's r. At New Boston
the Mississippi turns sharply, so that the mouth of Iowa r. is rather on the
S. than W.; and the bank on which is the town recedes northward, leaving low
ground between itself and the Mississippi, watered by the ramifications of Sturgeon
bay, Illinois slough, Swan lake, etc. This is what Pike means by his
"Sand-bank prairie on the E. side." As to that "marked Grant's prairie," I
should observe that no such name appears on the map as published; Pike referred
to his immense original draft in water-colors, now preserved in the War
Department, and from which the small printed map was reduced with the omission
of too many details. What he means by Grant's prairie is the lowlands on
the Iowa side before you come to Muscatine, which is the point where the hills
first reach the river-side. Compare Apr. 26th, 1806. Grant's prairie is now
known as Muscatine isl., being virtually cut off by Muscatine slough, whose
lower mouth is hardly 2 m. above the Iowa r., though the upper entrance is at
Muscatine&mdash;a distance of some 18-20 m. At one point this slough dilates into
a body of water which is now called Keokuk lake, but which was charted by
Nicollet as "L. Maskuding or in the Prairie." Here are obviously the origin and
meaning of the name "Muscatine." The town now so called was once known
as Bloomington. I suspect that "Grant's" prairie in Pike may be intended for
<i>Grande</i> prairie; thus Beltrami calls it Grande Prairie Mascotin, II. p. 196,
and Forsyth has Grand Mascoutin. There was a place started by the name of
Port Louisa on the Iowan side of the river, near one of the openings of Muscatine
slough; but it seems to have disappeared after bequeathing the name to
the county, whose seat is now Wapello. As to Pike's "28" miles to-day, that
is best disposed of by observing that to-morrow he drags his boat "nine miles,
to where the river Hills join the Mississippi," <i>i. e.</i>, to Muscatine. So he
camps on the Iowan side, a certain distance below Muscatine. We shall not
be far out if we set him exactly on the boundary between Louisa and
Muscatine cos., opp. the lower end of Blanchard's isl., behind the middle of
which Copperas or Copper cr. falls in on the Illinois side.</p>

<p class="footnote">The great Iowa r. should not be passed without remark. For the name in
its extreme fluidity, see Lewis and Clark, ed. 1893, p. 20. Some still more
singular forms of the word than those there noted reach us from the time when
the French writers and cartographers used the figure 8 for the letters <i>ou</i>; so that
"Iowa" was liable to appear as Ay8ay (Ayouay), or in some such form: Neill
cites forms sing. and pl. as Aye8ias, Ayo8ois, Ayooues, Ayavois, Ayoois,
Ayouez, Ayoes, Aaiaoua, to which I can add Aiavvi; another series of words
flows from the introduction of J or j: thus Pike, early text, 1807, p. 5, has Jowa,
and I have noticed also Ajoe, Jaway, Joway, Jowah, etc. Beltrami, 1828, has
Yawoha, Yahowa, and Yawowa. This river-system waters a great portion of
the State, on courses S., S. E., and E. Pike says elsewhere that in ascending
it 36 m. you come to a fork, the right-hand branch of which is called Red
Cedar r. Waiving any question of distance, this is correct; and moreover,
Red Cedar is the larger of the two forks, though by a very unusual freak of
nomenclature the united stream Iowa takes the name of the lesser fork. He
further says that Red Cedar r. branches out 300 m. from its mouth; which
triple forking is "called the Turkey's foot." This term seems to have lapsed;
the situation is in Black Hawk Co., above Cedar Falls, and one of the turkey's
toes is called Shell Rock r. The notable town of Cedar Rapids is lower
down, in Linn Co. The confluence of Iowa r. proper with Red Cedar is at
Fredonia, Louisa Co.; Pike's map represents this by the pitchfork-shaped object,
though it is not lettered with any name. He marks a village of Iowas "about
10 miles up," on the "right" bank, <i>i. e.</i>, on the right-hand side going up, left
bank. Iowa r. presents the anomaly of a great river with nothing to speak
of at its mouth (New Boston is across the Mississippi). "Iowa City" seems
never to have got much beyond its original wood-pile, and a similar "city"
which Nicollet charts by the name of Black Hawk would be hard to find now.
There is, however, a little place called Toolsboro, under the hill on the left
bank, 2 m. above the mouth of the Iowa.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-26" id="Footnote_I-26" href="#FNanchor_I-26"><span class="label">[I-26]</span></a> Pirogues: see L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 4. Pike uses this form consistently.
The most amusing variant of the word I have noticed occurs in Shea's Hennepin's
Descr. Louisiana, Eng. tr., 1880, p. 156, where we read, "a number of
parrakeets and about eighty cabins full of Indians," and an editorial note informs
us that "the French printer put peroquets, but Margry's Relation gives
the real word, 'pirogues,' 'canoes.'"</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-27" id="Footnote_I-27" href="#FNanchor_I-27"><span class="label">[I-27]</span></a> The distance between Muscatine and Rock Island is 28 or 29 m. by the
channel. As Pike has 6 or 8 m. to go before reaching Muscatine, makes
"28Â½" to-day, and "22" to-morrow, we can confidently set him down to-night
halfway between these two places&mdash;say vicinity of Montpelier, Muscatine Co.,
Ia., 4 or 5 m. below Buffalo, Ia., and Andalusia, Ill. There is no specially
notable point in this whole stretch, after Muscatine is passed; the most of a
place is Fairport, Ia., 3 m. above Tahma or Sweetland cr. Several places that
were started seem to have died young, if they were not stillborn; we find on
older maps such as Geneva, somewhere between Muscatine and Fairport on the
Iowa side, and Wyoming, apparently in the same position as Fairport now is.
Between Muscatine and Fairport the river is or was recently divided into Drury
slough, Wyoming slough, and Hersey chute betwixt these. Pine cr. falls in on
the Iowan side, 2Â½ m. above Fairport. Opposite Fairport the long Andalusia
slough opens, running down on the Illinois side all the way from Andalusia, a
distance of 9 m. Pike's camp was probably on the Iowan side (still in Muscatine
Co.); across the river he has Rock Island Co., Ill.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-28" id="Footnote_I-28" href="#FNanchor_I-28"><span class="label">[I-28]</span></a> Actually about 16 m., to one of the most definite locations of the voyage
thus far, in the heart of the present city of Davenport, seat of Scott Co., Ia., and
directly opposite Rock Island, seat of Rock Island Co., Ill. Soon after passing
present site of Montpelier, Pike went from Muscatine into Scott Co., Ia. Next
are the two towns directly opposite each other, of Buffalo, Ia., and Andalusia,
Ill.; the former is marked N. Buffalo on Nicollet's map; the other is called
Rockport on Owen's map, or Rockport was then where Andalusia is now.
Linwood, Ia., is a small place 2 m. above Buffalo; and 3 m. above this was the
site of Rockingham, Ia. This last was started directly opposite the mouth of
Rock r., but never flourished. In fact there is probably no place on the
Mississippi where more mushroom towns have been projected on paper by
unscrupulous speculators than about the mouth of Rock r.; and we observe
that they mostly had resounding names, well known in other parts of the world.
A certain Stephensonville is marked on Nicollet's map, apparently in the present
position of the city of Rock Island. In the mouth of Rock r. is a triangular
island, dividing the two outlets, and opposite this is Credit isl. (No. 312),
1Â½ m. long. Pike's camp in Davenport was probably about opposite the lower
point of Rock isl., 2Â½ m. long; this is No. 307 of the Engineers' chart, and
its lower end was utilized for the bridge built in 1869-72 by the C., R. I. and
P. R. R. (Act of Congr., July 26th, 1868).</p>

<p class="footnote">La RiviÃ¨re de Roche, or Ã  la Roche, of the French, which Pike and others
call Stoney or Stony and Rocky or Rock r., and which is now known by the
latter name, is the second largest in Illinois. It arises in Wisconsin, in the
region S. of Lake Winnebago, leaves that State at Beloit, and holds a general
S. W. course through Illinois to the Mississippi. It used to be called Kickapoo
r.&mdash;a name traceable to R. des Kicapous of Franquelin's map, 1688. Pike
gives its source as near Green bay of L. Michigan, and ascribes a length of 450
m., 300 of them navigable. His map letters "The largest Sac Vill." on its
S. side near the mouth, about the present position of Milan, and delineates the
extensive rapids of the Miss. r., above its mouth, which the text of the 28th
describes. Rock r. afforded one of the five or six principal waterways between
the Great Lakes and the Miss. r., the connection being made above the Horicon
marshes by portage from the small stream which falls into L. Winnebago at
Fond du Lac. But this way was less eligible than the Fox-Wisconsin route.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-29" id="Footnote_I-29" href="#FNanchor_I-29"><span class="label">[I-29]</span></a> See Lewis and Clark, ed. 1893, pp. 1202, 1203, 1211. James Aird and his
brother George were among the Sioux traders at the mouth of the Minnesota or
St. Pierre r. in 1803 and thereafter; others similarly engaged then and there
were Archibald Campbell, Duncan Graham, and Francis M. Dease.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-30" id="Footnote_I-30" href="#FNanchor_I-30"><span class="label">[I-30]</span></a> Davenport, Ia., to Le Claire, Ia., 16 m. by water; Rock Island, Ill., to
Port Byron, Ill., 17 m.; actual extent of the rapids somewhat less than either of
these distances. The chains, in ascending series, are called Lower, Moline,
Duck Creek, Winnebago, Campbell's, St. Louis, Crab Island, Sycamore, Smith's,
Upper. The principal islands are: Rock, No. 307, 2Â½ m. long, with the little
ones called Papoose (No. 308), Benham's, and Sylvan, alongside; Campbell's,
opp. Watertown, Ill.; Spencer's, opp. Hampton, Ill., on the Iowan side; and
Fulton's. A number of creeks make in on both sides; among them are Duck,
Crow, and Spencer's, on the Iowan side, and the one on the Illinois side which
falls in by Watertown, name unknown to me. The rapids were formerly
guarded by Fort Armstrong, occupying an eligible site on the extreme lower end
of Rock isl. A good account of this post, as it was in 1817, is found in
Long's Expedition of that year, printed in 1860 and reprinted in 1890, in Part I
of II. of the Minn. Hist. Coll., pp. 67-73. The places on the Illinois side are:
Moline, 3Â½ m. above Rock Island; Watertown, 5 m. above Moline; Hampton,
1 m. above Moline; Rapids City, 4Â½ m. above Hampton; Port Byron, 1
m. further; land distances less than by river-channel. On the Iowan side,
between Davenport and Le Claire, are places called Gilberttown or Gilbert, opp.
Moline, and Valley City or Pleasant Valley, opp. Hampton. Pike does not say
where he camped at the head of the rapids; but it was no doubt at Le Claire,
as the channel ran on the Iowan side.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-31" id="Footnote_I-31" href="#FNanchor_I-31"><span class="label">[I-31]</span></a> This Fox Indian village is located on Pike's map, but without name. It
was on the Iowan side, above the rapids&mdash;not at Le Claire, but somewhat
further up, at or near present town of Princeton, Scott Co., Ia. Forsyth in
1819 speaks of "the Little Fox village, 9 miles above the rapids." A mile
above Princeton, on the Illinois side, is Cordova, marked Cordawa on Owen's
map, and Berlin on Nicollet's.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-32" id="Footnote_I-32" href="#FNanchor_I-32"><span class="label">[I-32]</span></a> At 4 m. above Cordova, Pike passed on the left or Iowan side a river whose
name is perhaps the most remarkable thing about it: Wabisapencun, Pike's
map; Wabisipinekan, Pike's text, further on; Wabisapincun, Lewis and
Clark's map of 1814; Wapisipinacon, Long's; Wabezipinikan, Nicollet's;
Wabesapinica, Featherstonhaugh's; Wapsipinicon, Owen's and U.Â S. Eng'rs';
Wapsipinecon, G. L. O. No two original authors agree, and when one
tries to copy another he is liable to be foiled by his printer. But the river
runs on just the same, through several Iowan counties, on a general S. E.
course, approximately parallel in most of its extent with Red Cedar r. It
also does duty as the boundary between Scott and Clinton cos., Ia., along
most of their apposed extent. There are several islands about its mouth; one of
them is called Adams. Opposite the mouth of the W&mdash;&mdash;n r., for a space
of about 8 m. along the Illinois side of the Mississippi, the hills recede, leaving
a low place in which the body of water known as Marais d'Osier, or Lake
Willowmarsh, is situated: see Pike's map, in the interval between his "High
Prairie" (ending at Cordova) and his "Rocky Hills" (beginning about Albany).
Beltrami, II. 196, calls this Marais d'OgÃ©, and says it was "inhabited by
a savage of the same name"! Beltrami's bosom friend, Major Long, has a still
more startling rendition of the phrase, as Mer a Doge, in Minn. Hist. Coll.,
II. Part 1, 1860, 2d ed. 1890, p. 67. It appears as Mare de Oge on an
Illinois atlas before me. From Le Claire to Albany is 18 m.; Pike probably
did not get quite so far as this, but for convenience of keeping tally we will
assume that he did, and set him on the lower point of the great Beaver isl.
(No. 291), at the mouth of Comanche slough, directly opposite Albany,
Whiteside Co., Ill.; nearest place on the other side is Comanche or Camanche,
Clinton Co., Ia. Beaver isl. is 3 m. long, and extends up to Clinton, the
county seat.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-33" id="Footnote_I-33" href="#FNanchor_I-33"><span class="label">[I-33]</span></a> The distance by river-channel from Albany to Dubuque is reckoned 72 m.
Pike's figures are 43 + 31Â½ + 25 = 99Â½ m. The required reduction of mileage is
about one-fourth off; applying which to the "43" m. of the 30th, we find Pike
somewhere in the vicinity of Apple r., and may most conveniently set him at
its mouth. Decamping on the 30th, he first made the stretch of Beaver isl.,
past Cedar and Cat-tail crs., right, and came to Clinton. The original name of
this city, or of its site, was New York; both these terms seem to point back to
the time when Governor Dewitt C. Clinton was popular. The river was
spanned here by the bridge built by the C. and N. W. R. R. in 1864-65, utilizing
island No. 290. Two or three miles above stand, facing each other, Lyons,
Clinton Co., Ia., and Fulton, Whiteside Co., Ill.; around the other side of the
hill N. of Fulton, Otter cr. falls in. The line of hills on the Iowan side comes
to the river a mile above Lyons, but at once recedes again, leaving along the
river-side what is called the Pomme de Terre, Potato, or Ground Apple prairie,
at the head of which Elk r. or cr. falls in, 8 m. above Lyons. The recession
of the hills on the Illinois side from Fulton is much greater for a space of 16 m.,
where there is low ground for some miles back from the river, sloughy the
whole way near the river, and thus making various islands, the largest of which
are called Fulton and Savanna. Near the head of Fulton isl. is a little place
named Thompson, in Carroll Co., Ill. The line of Whiteside and Carroll
cos. strikes the river about halfway between Fulton (town) and Thompson.
On the Iowan side, the line of Clinton and Jackson cos. is between Elk r.
and Sabula. The latter town, or its site, used to be called Charleston. It
naturally grew after 1881, when the C., M. and St. P. R. R. built the bridge
here, under Act of Congr., Apr. 1st, 1872. The site of Sabula is called Prairie
du Frappeur, Beltrami, II. p. 196, where it is said to have been "inhabited by
a savage of that name." Before crossing the river, the track ran for a couple
of miles on Savanna isl., at the head of which Plum r. falls in; and immediately
above this point is Savanna, Carroll Co., Ill., 2Â½ m. from Sabula. The high
ground comes close to the river at Savanna, but on the Iowan side there is sloughy
bottom for 4 m. above Sabula, all this lowland being known as Keller's isl.;
above this, higher ground comes to the river-side at Keller's bar. Rush or Big
Rush cr. falls in on the Illinois side 5 m. above Savanna, and 2 m. further is
the mouth of La Pomme or Apple r., nearly up to the boundary between
Carroll and Jo Daviess cos., Ill. One Arnold used to have his landing a mile
below Apple r., about where we suppose Pike to have camped.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-34" id="Footnote_I-34" href="#FNanchor_I-34"><span class="label">[I-34]</span></a> Whatever the exact distance represented by this mileage, we have to set
the Expedition down in a very unhealthy place to-night, as will presently appear.
Soon after decamping from Apple r.,&mdash;that is, in 5 miles' distance by the
channel, Pike passes on his left a notable stream, which he elsewhere calls the
Great Macoketh. This is Makokety r. of Nicollet, Maquoketa r. of others,
whose name is now usually spelled Makoqueta. This is also the designation of
the county seat of Jackson, situated upon the river. It falls in opposite Sand
prairie, about where the line between Carroll and Jo Daviess cos. strikes the
river. The "beautiful eminence on the W." which Pike observed is Leopold
hill, near Bellevue, Jackson Co., Ia. This town existed before Nicollet's map
was made, as he marks it by name. The locality called ChÃ©niere by Beltrami
II. 196, was hereabouts. He gives it on the W., 10 m. above his R. la Pomme.
The hills begin to approach the river four or five miles below Bellevue, and so
continue with little interruption to Dubuque. The trough of the river is
similar on the Illinois side, but the hills do not hug the river so closely, leaving
a stretch of sloughy bottom, especially at the delta of the Galena r. This
is the insalubrious place of encampment. The Galena was long named, and is
still sometimes called, Fever r. The same slough by which it discharges
receives Smallpox cr.; and on the Iowan side, opposite Harris slough, which
is the upper end of the Fever delta, a creek falls in known as TÃªte du Mort, or
TÃªte des Morts. It must have been a choice region of saturnine and miasmatic
poisons, as the victims of lead-palsy and ague-cake who lived on
Fever r. had the option of moving down on Smallpox cr. or over to Death's-head
cr. The place to avoid is pointed out to Mississippian tourists by Pilot
Knob, an isolated eminence on the prairie near the variolous creek, 3 m. S. of
the city of Galena, which is about the same distance up the febrile stream. The
cranial creek is said to have been so named on account of the number of skulls
which resulted from an Indian fight there. On this point Beltrami, 1828, II.
p. 160, has "a place called the Death's-heads; a field of battle where the Foxes
defeated the Kikassias [Kaskaskias?], whose heads they fixed upon poles as
trophies of their victory. We stopped at the entrance of the river la FiÃ¨vre,
a name in perfect conformity with the effect of the bad air which prevails
there." Nor do I know what terrors may be hidden under the name of
Sinsinawa cr., which makes in a mile or two higher up, on the Illinois side.
Two of the sloughs at the delta are called respectively Harris' and Spratt's;
a third is Stone slough. One Gordon established a ferry here, many years ago,
and a place on the Iowan side, close to the boundary between Jackson and
Dubuque cos., is still known as Gordon's ferry. Regarding the nomenclature
of Galena r., we should not omit to cite here Keating's Long's Exp. of
1823, published 1824, I. p. 212, where it is stated that Smallpox cr. and
Fever r. are the same: "a small stream, called by the Indians Mekabea
Sepe, or Small-pox river; it is the Riviere de la Fievre, which is said to enter
the Mississippi opposite to Dubuque's mines." Probably not much weight
attaches to this observation, which Major Long only made parenthetically, and
evidently at second-hand information, in speaking of a badger which his party
had killed and cooked; though it is also quite possible that Galena r. once
rejoiced in both names, one of which was later conferred upon the small creek
which enters its delta. That Long knew the Galena as La FiÃ¨vre r. is certain,
for he uses the latter name, though without any accent, in the narrative of
his voyage of 1817, in speaking of reaching it on Monday, July 28th, of that
year. See Minn. Hist. Coll., II. Part 1, 1860; 2d ed. 1890, p. 66. It appears
that Long's MS. of his voyage of 1817 was placed in Prof. Keating's hands when
the latter was preparing for publication the history of Long's Expedition of
1823. This source of information was freely drawn upon; in fact, I do not
see that Prof. Keating did not fully avail himself of this opportunity to editorially
embody in the narrative of 1823 the whole substance of the 1817 materials,
in so far as Major Long went over the same ground in the two expeditions.
But the earlier narrative contains considerable matter not pertinent to the later
one, inasmuch as Major Long in 1817 traversed a long section of the Mississippi
that he did not retrace in 1823. On this particular account, as well as for more
general reasons, it was desirable and eminently fitting that Long's Expedition
of 1817 should be published; and that was first done in long after-years by my
friend, the late Rev. Edw. D. Neill, the veteran Minnesota historian, who received
the MS. for this purpose from Dr. Edwin James, then of Burlington, Ia.
(who d. Oct. 28th, 1861). As originally published under Dr. Neill's careful
editorship, the article was entitled: "Voyage in a Six-Oared Skiff to the Falls
of Saint Anthony in 1817. By Major Stephen H. Long, Topographical
Engineer United States Army," and formed Part 1 of Vol. II. of the Minn.
Hist. Coll., 1860 (about 80 pages); 2d ed. 1890, half-title and introductory
note by E. D. N., one leaf; journal, pp. 9-83; map and appendix, prepared
by A. J. Hill, pp. 84-88. Major Long's movements of 1817 occupied
76 days, of which the journal here printed covers the period from July 9th to
Aug. 15th, both inclusive, or 38 days; as it picks up Major Long after his return
to Prairie du Chien from a tour of the Fox-Wisconsin portage, takes him from
that Prairie to the falls, and returns him to Bellefontaine, near the mouth of the
Missouri. The objects of this voyage were to meander the upper Mississippi and
take its topography, with special reference to the selection of military sites. It
was performed in a boat furnished by Governor William Clark, Superintendent
of Indian Affairs at St. Louis. Its most important single result was the speedy
occupation of the mouth of St. Peter's r. for a military post, at first called
Fort St. Anthony, and in 1824 named Fort Snelling; but the narrative is
replete with matter of permanent historical and scientific interest. Major Long
was a conscientious, competent, and well-equipped explorer, as all three of his
important and memorable expeditions attest. The present expedition is the
only one of which we have the account from his own pen, as Dr. James and
Prof. Keating, respectively, were the authors of the other two. Stephen Harriman
Long, of New Hampshire, was appointed from that State a second lieutenant
of Engineers Dec. 12th, 1814, and brevetted major of Topographical Engineers
Apr. 29th, 1816, though his actual majority in that corps was not reached
till July 7th, 1838. He became colonel Sept. 9th, 1861, was retired June 1st,
1863, and died at Alton, Ill., Sept. 4th, 1864.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-35" id="Footnote_I-35" href="#FNanchor_I-35"><span class="label">[I-35]</span></a> This Dubuque matter formed a part of Doc. No. 2 of App. to Part 1 of the
orig. ed., p. 5, and will be found beyond: see <a href="#Page_226">Chap. v. Art. 3</a>. The document
was transmitted to General Wilkinson by Pike from Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-36" id="Footnote_I-36" href="#FNanchor_I-36"><span class="label">[I-36]</span></a> Chippewas, or Ojibways&mdash;of whom Pike has much to say in this volume.
The French nickname he uses, found also as Saulteurs, Saulteux, Saltiaux,
Sautiers, Saltiers, Soutors, Soters, etc., was not given because these Indians
were better jumpers than any others, but because the band of Chippewas whom
it originally designated lived about the Sault de Sainte Marie, or St. Mary's
falls, of Lake Superior. The term afterward became synonymous with
Chippewas or Ojibways in a broad sense. On the map of Champlain's Voy.,
Paris, 1632, the Sault is marked du Gaston, for the brother of Louis XIII., and
there located between Mer Douce and Grand Lac, <i>i. e.</i>, between Lakes
Huron and Superior. The chute seems to have been first heard of about
1616-18, from one Ãtienne BruslÃ©, or Stephen Broolay. In 1669, when the
Jesuits reached the place, they changed the name to compliment the B. V. M.
There is no doubt that Ojibwa or Ojibway is preferable to Chippewa or Chippeway,
as a name of the tribe; but the latter is best established, both in official
history and in geography, and may be most conveniently retained. These are
the same word, etymologically, and are mere samples of the extraordinary profusion
of forms in which the name exists. Very likely 50 different combinations
of letters could be produced, some of them bearing little resemblance to one
another. The meaning of the name is in chronic dispute. The linguistic
sages seem to be agreed that the word has something to do with <i>puckering</i>;
but whether it refers to the place which is puckered up between the two lakes
above said, or to the way the moccasins of these Indians were puckered along
a peculiar seam, or to the habits of these Indians of torturing with fire till the
skins of their prisoners were puckered by burning to a crisp, are questions much
agitated. The learned Anglojibway, Hon. W. W. Warren, historian of his
tribe, takes the latter view, saying: "The word is composed of <i>o-jib</i>, 'pucker
up,' and <i>ub-way</i>, 'to roast,' and it means, 'to roast till puckered up.'" Mr.
Warren adduces also the name Abboinug, literally Roasters, given by the Ojibways
to the Sioux, from the same horrid practice. He says that the Ojibways,
as a distinct tribe or people, denominate themselves Awishinaubay. Probably
the best account we possess of these Indians is that given in the Minn. Hist.
Coll., V. of which is almost entirely devoted to the subject (pp. 1-510, 1885).
This consists of Warren's history, based on traditions, and of Neill's, based
on documents. The two thus admirably complement each other, and are preceded
by a memoir of Warren, by J. Fletcher Williams.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-37" id="Footnote_I-37" href="#FNanchor_I-37"><span class="label">[I-37]</span></a> Our name of these Siouan Indians comes from their Algonkin appellation,
which reached us through an assortment of French forms like Ouinipigou
(as Vimont, Relation, 1640), etc., several of which have served as the originals
of place-names now fixed in current usage. The term Puants, meaning Stinkers,
was the French nickname. It is found as Puans, Pauns, Pawns, Paunts, etc.,
originated very early, and was much in vogue. On the old map cited in the foregoing
note appears the legend "La Nation des Puans," though these Indians,
with their Green bay, are marked on it N. instead of S. of Lakes Superior
and Huron. The Stinkards gave occasion for a Latin synonym, as seen in the
phrase "Magnus Lacus Algonquiniorum seu Lacus F&oelig;tentium" of De Creux's
map, Hist. Canada, Paris, 1664. They were also called Gens de Mer, Sea People.
Jean Nicolet of Cherbourg in France, in the service of Champlain's Hundred
Associates, believed to have been the first white man to enter Green bay, in
July, 1634, calls them by their own name of themselves, which he renders
Ochunkgraw, and which later acquired a variety of forms: see <a href="#Footnote_I-44">note<sup>44</sup></a>, p. 39,
and Butterfield's Disc. N. W., 1881, <i>passim</i>, esp. p. 38.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-38" id="Footnote_I-38" href="#FNanchor_I-38"><span class="label">[I-38]</span></a> Pike did not get far from Dubuque, if he left at 4 p. m. He probably
stopped at the first convenient place to camp above the bluff, in the vicinity of
Little Makoqueta r.&mdash;perhaps on the spot where Sinipi, Sinipee, or Sinope
was started. In bringing him up to Dubuque from the Galena delta we have
not much to note: Suisinawa, Sinsinawa, or Sinsinniwa r., right; Menomonee
cr., right, and Catfish cr., left, between which is Nine Mile isl.; Massey,
Ia., town at Dodge's branch; East Dubuque, Ill., rather below the large city of
Dubuque. This is the oldest establishment in Iowa, as the Canadian Frenchman
Julien Dubuque came there in 1788; extinction of Indian title and permanent
settlement not till 1833; town incorporated 1837; city charter, 1840; pop.
3,100 in 1850: for the rest, see any gazetteer or cyclopedia. With this day's
journey Pike finishes Illinois, which has been on his right all the way, and takes
Wisconsin on that side; but Iowa continues on his left. The interstate line
runs on the parallel of 42Â° 30Â´ N., which cuts through Dubuque.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-39" id="Footnote_I-39" href="#FNanchor_I-39"><span class="label">[I-39]</span></a> From Dubuque to Cassville is only 30 m., and Pike was somewhat advanced
beyond Dubuque when he started. "The mouth of Turkey river,"
opp. which he camped, is of course a fixed point; and this shows the required
reduction of his "40" miles to somewhat under 30. Determinations like these
would be proof, were any needed, of the proposition advanced at the start, that
the set of mileages with which we have to deal require a discount of 20 to 25
per cent. as a rule. In making his "two short reaches," Pike passed his Little
Macoketh, the Little Makoqueta r., on his left, and the extensive slough on
his right which receives the discharges of Platte and Grant rivers. He maps
the former river: see the unnamed stream on the left, where "M<sup>r</sup>. Dubuques
Houfe" and "Lead Mines" are lettered. The other two rivers are not laid
down; they run in Grant Co., Wis. Beltrami, II. 196, has a locality on the
W. said to be 16 m. above Dubuque's mines, and to be called Prairie Macotche,
"from the name of a savage who inhabited it." This item is no doubt imaginary;
but Macotche is clearly the same word as Makoqueta. Pike's "long reach"
is the 15 m. or more where the river is straight; it begins about Specht's Ferry
(opp. which the Potosi canal was dug for an outlet of Grant r.) and extends
to Turkey r. On the left, about halfway along this stretch, is the town of
Waupeton (Wahpeton, Warpeton, etc.), at or near which the boundary between
Dubuque and Clayton cos. strikes the Mississippi; the town of Buenavista, Clayton
Co., Ia., is 3Â½ m. higher, between Plum and Panther crs. On the right a
snicarty 11 m. long connects Grant r. with Jack Oak slough, at the head of which
Cassville is situated, at the mouth of Furnace cr., and obliquely opposite the
mouth of Turkey r. Some places which started along the river have failed, or
changed their names; I do not now find Osceola, which maps mark near the
mouth of Platte r.; nor Lafayette, which started about the present site of Potosi,
and is now marked by some dilapidated chimneys you will observe when the
C., B. and Q. train stops at a sort of station there; nor Frenchtown and Finlay,
both on the Iowan side, the latter at the mouth of a creek called Bastard on a
map of 1857; nor Frankford, at or near Buenavista; nor Winchester, about
the mouth of Turkey r. Whether by accident or design, Grant r. is lettered
"Le Grand R." on Nicollet's map. The Fox village, whose women and children
were so frightened at the sight of the Americans, is marked by Pike on
the N. side of Turkey r., near its mouth, about where Winchester seems to
have stood. Present Turkey R. Junction of the C., M. and St. P. R. R. is on
the other side. This stream is "Turkies" r. of Beltrami, II. p. 196.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-40" id="Footnote_I-40" href="#FNanchor_I-40"><span class="label">[I-40]</span></a> Probably 19 m., Cassville to Clayton, Ia., whence he could go comfortably
for breakfast to Wyalusing, Wis., or still nearer the Wisconsin r. Above the
mouth of Turkey r. the Miss. r. is divided into two courses, called the Casville
slough on the Wisconsin side and the Guttenberg channel on the Iowan
side. The latter is the broadest course, but the former is, or was some years
ago, the main channel. The two come together 10 m. above Cassville, and
a mile or two above Glen Haven, Wis. Guttenberg, Ia., is 8 m. above Cassville,
at the mouth of Miners, Miner's, or Miners' cr.; it seems to have been
formerly called Prairie La Port, as marked on Nicollet's map. Buck or Back
cr. falls in a mile above. Approaching Clayton the banks are high and abrupt
on the Iowan side, but on the other the hills recede, leaving a sloughy bottom
into which several creeks empty, one of them Sandy cr., which comes by a
sort of sand-bank. In this vicinity there was a place called Cincinnati, Wis.,
which seems to have disappeared, like another called Kilroy, on the Iowan
side. Owen's map marks Killroy, a Clayton Co. map of 1857 has Keleroy, and
Nicollet lays down the sizable creek near which it appears to have been situated,
now known as the Sny Magill. The distance from Clayton to Wyalusing is
3 m.; thence it is about the same to the Wisconsin r.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-41" id="Footnote_I-41" href="#FNanchor_I-41"><span class="label">[I-41]</span></a> R. des Ouisconsins on Hennepin's map, 1683, and thus near the modern
form, though in the plural for the Indians and with <i>ou</i> for the letter <i>w</i> that the
F. alphabet lacks; in Hennepin's text, <i>passim</i>, Ouscousin, Oviscousin, Onisconsin,
Misconsin, etc., according to typesetter's fancy; Ouisconsing, Misconsing,
etc., in La Salle, and there also Meschetz Odeba; Miscou, Joliet on one
of his maps, Miskonsing on another; Ouisconching, Perrot; Ouisconsinc,
Lahontan's map; Ouisconsing, Franquelin's map, 1688; Ouisconsin, Carver;
variable in Pike; Owisconsin and Owisconsing in Beltrami; Wisconsan, consistently,
in Long; Wisconsin in Nicollet, and most writers since his time.
Were it not for La Salle's appearance on the Illinois r. in 1680, and his sending
Hennepin down it to the Mississippi, when he dispatched Michael Accault
and Antoine Auguelle from Fort CrÃªvec&oelig;ur to trade with the Chaas, the Wisconsin
would rank first in historical significance as a waterway to the Mississippi
from the Great Lakes; and such priority of date is offset in favor of the Wisconsin
as the best and most traveled route from the lakes to points below the Falls of
St. Anthony. It was already an Indian highway when it was first known to the
whites, and did not cease to be such when the paddle was exchanged for the
paddlewheel. A pretty full account of the Fox-Wisconsin route will be rendered
beyond in this work. There are accounts of white settlements, or at least trading-posts,
at Prairie du Chien about 1755; but white men may have lived in this
vicinity, if not upon the spot, long before that, for Franquelin's map of 1688
locates a certain Fort St. Nicolas in what appears to be the position of P.
du Chien, as well as I can judge. Moreover, Joliet and Marquette reached
the Mississippi r. by way of the Fox-Wisconsin, June 15th or 17th, 1673. Our
most definite information, however, dates from Oct. 15th, 1766, when Carver
came to the spot. He reached it by the Fox-Wisconsin route, went up the
Mississippi as high as the river St. Francis, wintered 1766-67 up the St. Peter,
returned to P. du C. in the summer of 1767, went up the Mississippi again to
the Chippewa r., and by that river back to the Great Lakes in July, 1767. He
called the place Prairie le Chien; at the time of his visit it was "a large town
containing about 300 families," with houses well built after the Indian fashion,
and a great trade center for all the country roundabout. Carver also called the
place Dog Plains. This is plain as a transl. of the F., and nobody doubts what
Prairie du Chien denotes; what it connotes, however, or its actual implication,
is another question which has been much mooted. Pike states elsewhere in
this work that the place&mdash;which, by the way, he seldom if ever calls Prairie
du Chien, but de Chein, des Cheins, etc.&mdash;was named for Indian<i>s</i> who lived
here, known as Reynards, etc., and would translate this F. nickname either Fox,
Wolf, or Dog; in one place he has Dog's Plain. But Wolf or Dog does not
seem to have been the name used for this tribe, which, when they were not called
Ottagamies (or by some form of that word) were either the Reynards of the
French or the Foxes of the English and Americans. Beltrami, II., p. 170, has
that "it takes its name from an Indian family whom the first Frenchmen met there,
called Kigigad or Dog." The whole weight of evidence is on the side of a personal
name in the singular number. Long states that P. du C. was named after
an Indian who lived there and was called the Dog. This may bear on Pike's
statement, and the latter may be explicable upon the understanding that it refers
to certain Indians, not necessarily of the Reynard tribe, who were called Dog
Indians, <i>i. e.</i>, The Dog's Indians. Nicollet marks the Indian town by the
Chippewa name, Kipy Saging; Schoolcraft renders this Tipisagi, with reference
to the treaty of Prairie du Chien. At the time of Long's 1823 visit the village
had about 20 dwelling-houses besides the stores, most of them old and some
decaying; the pop. was about 150. He located the place as in lat. 43Â° 3Â´ 31Â´Â´ N.,
long. 90Â° 52Â´ 30Â´Â´ W.; magn. var. 8Â° 48Â´ 52Â´Â´ E. Long speaks of one Mr. Brisbois,
who had long resided there; of Mr. Rolette of the Am. Fur Co.; and of
Augustin Roque, a half-breed and whole-fraud, to whom we shall refer again.
Fort Crawford began to be built July 3d, 1816, by the troops under the command
of Lieutenant-Colonel William S. Hamilton of North Carolina, who had
attained that rank in the 3d Rifles Feb. 21st, 1814, and who resigned from the
army March 8th, 1817; it would hold four or five companies, but was a mean
establishment, poorly built on a bad site, too near Rousseau channel and the
Kipy Saging slough. Long relates that in 1822 the fort as well as the village
was inundated, so that the water stood three or four feet deep on the parade
ground and ran into the officers' quarters and the barracks, forcing the garrison
to camp for a month on higher ground. One of the blockhouses of the fort was
built on a mound which was large enough to have supported the whole establishment,
though only the stockade ran up to it. Through the attentions of
Wm. Hancock Clark of Detroit, Mich., I am in possession of a water-color
picture of the fort, roughly but tellingly done by his illustrious grandfather,
William Clark, who with Governor Lewis Cass effected the important treaty of
P. du C., Aug. 19th, 1825. This measures 18 Ã 15 inches, and shows a part of
the stockade straggling up to that one of the blockhouses which was on the hill
or mound, as described by Long. The general effect upon the beholder is to
suggest something of a cross between a penitentiary and a stockyard, but unsafe
for criminals and too small for cattle. The remains are extant, and may be
observed about 40 rods W. of the railroad track, half a mile S. of the station of
the C., B. and Q. This Fort Crawford must not be confounded with the earlier
one of the same name, built in 1812 or sooner, at the N. end of the town, close
to Rousseau channel. This site was near the positions of the two early French
settlements, as distinguished from the later one that grew up S. of the site of
the second Fort Crawford. Our actual settlement, continued on as the Prairie
du Chien of to-day, only dates from 1835 or thereabouts, after the cessation of
Indian hostilities in that quarter; the town is now the seat of Crawford Co.,
Wis. It is in the very S. W. corner of the county, which is separated from
Grant Co. by the Wisconsin r. The bridge across the Mississippi to N.
McGregor was built in 1873-74 and altered in 1888; C., M. and St. P. R. R.;
Act of Congr. legalizing, June 6th, 1874. Notwithstanding its prominent situation,
its distinguished history, and its comparative antiquity, Prairie du Chien
has never amounted to much, and probably never will. There is nothing the
matter with the place&mdash;the trouble is with the people. The place to-day cuts a
lesser figure than it did in Pike's time, when it was our extreme frontier post in
that direction, and it continued to be such until Fort St. Anthony (Snelling)
was built. A part of the difficulty is ecclesiastical; no priest-ridden community
can expect to keep up with the times. Prairie du Chien is an antique curio,
comparing with the rest of Wisconsin very much as Quebec does with Ontario&mdash;and
for similar reasons.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-42" id="Footnote_I-42" href="#FNanchor_I-42"><span class="label">[I-42]</span></a> The bluff W. bank of the Miss. r., opp. P. du C., was later called Pike's
mountain; which, says Long's MSS. of 1817, No. I, fol. 37, as cited by Keating,
1824, received its name from having been recommended by the late General
Pike, in his journal, "as a position well calculated for the construction of a
military post to command the Mississippi." But this recommendation is nowhere
made in Pike's journal: it is made in a <a href="#Page_223">letter</a> which Pike wrote to General
Wilkinson from P. du C., this date of Sept. 5th, as the above text says,
and which formed in the orig. ed. Doc. No. 2 of the App. to Part I&mdash;the same
that covered the Dubuque report. The particular hill that Pike picked out does
not differ from the general range of bluffs which extend on that side of the river
for several miles, all of about the same elevation. But to be particular, it was
that hill which stands between McGregor and N. McGregor. The original settlement
of McGregor was called in the first instance McGregor's landing. This
was 1Â½ mile below N. McGregor, built at the mouth of the creek that comes
down by Pike's mountain. This stream used to be known as Giard or Gayard
r. (latter on Pike's map), and these were common spellings of the name of a
person otherwise known as Gaillard, of mixed French-Indian blood, said to
have been, with Antaya and Dubuque, one of the three first white settlers at
Prairie du Chien, and by Long to have died suddenly during the latter's expedition
up the Wisconsin r. The present name of the creek is Bloody Run,
which may easily have acquired if it did not deserve the designation in some one
or more of the uncounted fierce collisions of this blood-brued region. But tradition,
if not authentic history, ascribes the origin of the sanguinary title to the
Nimrodic exploits of the celebrated Captain Martin Scott, a mighty hunter who
used to kill so much game in that vicinity that he was said to have made this
stream literally run with blood. But so much used to be told about Captain
Scott&mdash;on whom was fathered in those parts the story of the coon which promised
to come down if he would not shoot, elsewhere connected with the name
of Davy Crockett&mdash;that the legends concerning him may pass for what they
may be worth. The mouth of this creek is 3 m. below that of Yellow r., and
the boundary between Clayton and Allamakee cos. strikes the Mississippi
between the two, though very near the mouth of the latter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-43" id="Footnote_I-43" href="#FNanchor_I-43"><span class="label">[I-43]</span></a> See <a href="#Footnote_I-7">note <i>anteÃ </i>, p. 5</a>, where the phrase Cap au GrÃ¨s is mentioned. Pike's
term Petit Gris, elsewhere Petit Grey, would be preferably rendered Petit Cap
au GrÃ¨s, in the peculiar system of phonetics which our Parisian friends are wont
to enjoy. This Little Sandstone bluff extends up the Wisconsin in the direction
of Bridgeport. A small creek which comes down a break in the bluff, and
empties into the N. side of the Wisconsin a mile above its mouth, is also named
Petit Gris or GrÃ¨s. There was also a Grand GrÃ¨s in that vicinity&mdash;to judge
from a creek I find on some maps by the name of Grandgris&mdash;perhaps the
branch of the Wisconsin now known as Kickapoo r. Pike's recommendation
of the Petit GrÃ¨s as a military site was never acted upon.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-44" id="Footnote_I-44" href="#FNanchor_I-44"><span class="label">[I-44]</span></a> I think Pike never once hits what a grammarian would consider the proper
way to write this phrase. Wherever he happens upon it, the gender or the
number gets awry. The hitch in pluralizing seems to be because the first <i>s</i> is
sounded before the initial vowel of the next word, but the last <i>s</i> is silent, because
the French seldom articulate their letters at par. <i>Folle avoine</i>, literally
"fool oat"&mdash;a phrase also reflected in the Latin term <i>avena fatua</i>&mdash;is the
Canadian French name of the plant known to botanists as <i>Zizania aquatica</i>,
and to us common folks as wild rice, wild oats, water-rice, water-oats, Indian or
Canadian rice or oats, etc. My friend Prof. Lester F. Ward, whom I desired
to prepare the botanical definitions for the Century Dictionary, and who did
write them, with the assistance of Mr. F. H. Knowlton, after the lamented
death of Prof. Sereno Watson, Prof. Asa Gray's successor at Cambridge, defines
<i>Zizania</i> as "a genus of grasses, of the tribe <i>OryzeÃ¦</i>. It is characterized
by numerous narrow unisexual spikelets in a long, loose androgynous panicle,
each spikelet having two glumes and six stamens or two more or less connate
styles." This would be news to the Menominees, though these Indians subsisted
so largely upon the seeds of the plant that the French called them les
Folles Avoines, and the English knew them as the Rice-eaters. This rice
grows in profusion in all the lacustrine regions of the N. W., and is regularly
harvested by all the Indians of that country, to be sold or bartered as well as
eaten by them. Its great size, its purplish spike-like heads when ripe, and its
omnipresence, render it one of the most conspicuous products of the region.
The Indians do not cut the stalk as we reap our cereals, because the loose grains
fall so readily that the easiest way to gather them is to simply shake or beat them
into a canoe. As to the polyglot council which Pike held with the Puants, we
may hope without believing that the Winnebagoes were deeply impressed by the
combination of New Jersey and Canadian French which fell upon their ears
through the Dakotan tongue. It is true that the Winnebagoes come of Siouan
stock, and so have some linguistic affinity with the Sioux; but the dialect they
acquired is conceded by all philologists to be peculiar to themselves, and peculiarly
difficult to utter. The Winnebago spoken at this council was probably as
different from the Dakotan as Latin is from its cognate Greek, or even as Pike's
French was from that spoken in Montreal or Paris. The Winnebagoes call
themselves by a name which is rendered Otchagra by Long, Howchungera by
Featherstonhaugh, HotcaÃ±gara by Powell; also Ochungarand, Hohchunhgrah,
and in various other ways which authors prefer and printing-offices permit:
see <a href="#Footnote_I-37">note<sup>37</sup></a>, p. 31. Since Charlevoix they have been known as Puans, Puants,
or Stinkers&mdash;and they deserve to be. Their vernacular is noted for the predominance
of the growler or dog-letter <i>r</i>, <i>litera canina</i> of the Latin grammarians.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-45" id="Footnote_I-45" href="#FNanchor_I-45"><span class="label">[I-45]</span></a> Billon's Ann. St. Louis, 1804-21, pub. 1888, p. 382, is obviously in error
in stating that Pierre Rousseau embarked with Pike at St. Louis; for here we
have him first hired at P. du C. I know nothing further of the man; but he
is doubtless the one from whom Rousseau channel of the Miss. r., which runs
past P. du C. on the Wis. side, as distinguished from the main steamboat channel
past McGregor on the Iowan side, derived its name.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-46" id="Footnote_I-46" href="#FNanchor_I-46"><span class="label">[I-46]</span></a> Joseph Reinville or Renville was the name of two persons, father and son,
former French-Canadian, latter half-breed by a Sioux squaw of the village of
Petit Corbeau or Little Raven (Kaposia). Long extolls him for ability and
fidelity as an interpreter, remarking that he had met with few men that appeared
"to be gifted with a more inquiring and discerning mind, or with more force
and penetration," Keating, Exp. of 1823, I. p. 312. Reinville naturally acquired
great influence over the Indians, and when the British decided to use
such allies in the war of 1812-14, he was selected by Colonel Robert Dickson
as the man who could be most relied upon to command the Sioux. In his military
capacity he received the rank, pay, and emoluments of a captain in the
British army, and distinguished himself as well by humanity as by gallantry in
war. After this he entered the service of the H. B. Co.; left it, relinquishing
also his British pension, and returned to his old trading-post near the sources of
Red r., where he established the successful Columbia Fur Co. Reinville had
that energy and independence which enabled him to decide for himself and act
upon his decisions; he therefore made bitter enemies as well as warm friends,
whose judgments of his character and conduct were, of course, as diverse as
their feelings for or against him. Reinville was born at Kaposia, near St. Paul,
about 1779, and died in March, 1846: see sketch of his life by Rev. E. D.
Neill in Minn. Hist. Soc. Coll., I., 2d ed. 1872, pp. 196-206.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-47" id="Footnote_I-47" href="#FNanchor_I-47"><span class="label">[I-47]</span></a> This Frazer I do not doubt was a relative of the Robert Frazer, Frazier,
Fraser, etc., who accompanied Lewis and Clark. The latter was a "Green
Mountain boy," and it is highly improbable that two unrelated Frazers came
from Vermont to the Western frontiers in the beginning of this century.
But I can only conjecture what their degree of kinship was. One
Joseph Jack Frazer cut a figure in early Minnesota history, if we may judge
from the sketches of his life and adventures which ran through the columns of
the St. Paul Pioneer, about 1866 or 1867, from the pen of General Henry Hastings
Sibley. In this connection I may be permitted to note the fact, not generally
known, that Robert Frazer was one of several annalists of that famous
expedition, who went so far as to issue a MS. prospectus of a book he was going
to publish about it, with Captain Lewis' own sanction. But this project failed
for lack of subscribers to what any publisher would now be glad to accept,
could the MSS. be found. See Prof. James D. Butler's review of my L. and
C., N. Y. Nation, Oct. 26th and Nov. 2d, 1893.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-48" id="Footnote_I-48" href="#FNanchor_I-48"><span class="label">[I-48]</span></a> Pike's was luckier than Long's boat-party of 1823, which started from P.
du C. as Pike did, but did not get much above Yellow r. It consisted of
Thomas Say, the subsequently distinguished naturalist; Prof. W. H. Keating;
Mr. Samuel Seymour, the artist; the rascally interpreter Roque or Rocque; and
Lieutenant Martin Scott, the latter in command of a corporal and his squad of
eight soldiers. These men tapped a keg of liquor, and got too drunk to navigate&mdash;the
crew did, I mean, for it is well known that officers never drink. Yellow
r. is present name of the stream consistently so called since it ceased to be
R. Jaune of the French rÃ©gime; it has been already mentioned as falling in on
the W., 3 m. above Bloody Run and N. McGregor. Three miles higher, on
the same side, is Paint cr., or Painted Rock cr., near a place full of historic interest;
for at one point along the almost unbroken bluffs is the steep escarpment
which became known to the F. as Roche Peinte, or Rochers Peints, and which
continues to be called Painted Rock or Rocks, from the Indian pictographs with
which it was adorned for ages. Beltrami gives it as Pointed Rock, II. p. 196.
High places of all sorts, whether the elevation be phallic or terrene, have
always been regarded as great medicine by the untutored, from the days of the
priests of Baal, Moloch, or Jahveh, to those of the similar shamans and marvel-mongers
of Lo. Such theological jugglery is reflected in the present
name of Waucon or Waukon Junction, near the mouth of Paint cr., where the
Chic., Dub. and Minn. R. R., meandering the river, sends the Waukon branch
to Waukon, seat of Allamakee Co., Ia. A town, or something that tried to be
one, by the prosaic name of Johnsonsport, is to be found on some maps at the
mouth of Paint cr. About 4 m. above Waukon Junction is a place called
Harper's Ferry, suggestive of Virginian emigration. The bluffs hug the Iowan
bank closely to Paint cr. The opposite side is low for some miles back,
with sloughs or bayous known as Marais, Courtois, Sioux, etc., into which drain
several creeks, among them one called Fisher's&mdash;no doubt for the gentleman
who entertained Pike&mdash;and another named Pickadee; both these are received in
Sioux bayou. But above Paint cr. the channel runs, or recently did run, on
the Wisconsin side, having an intricate snicarty on the other, whose various
courses are known as Seaman's slough, Big Suck-off, Gordon's bay, Martell's
lake, Center, Harper, St. Paul, Crooked, Ferry, etc., sloughs. Wherever the
channel was in Pike's time, he says that he camped on the W. side, and I suppose
at a point about opposite present town of Lynxville, Crawford Co., Wis.,
which is reckoned 17 m. above P. du C. by comparatively recent hydrographers.
To reach this place he passed Trout cr., which falls in on the right hand nearly
opp. Painted Rock, and the site of Viola, at the mouth of Buck cr., also on the
right.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-49" id="Footnote_I-49" href="#FNanchor_I-49"><span class="label">[I-49]</span></a> Say Island No. 142, or head of No. 143, for a present location which exactly
fits, being on E. side, 4 or 5 m. below mouth of Upper Iowa r., and
opp. De Soto, Wis., on the border of Crawford and Vernon cos. The camp
itself is of little consequence, in comparison with the notable points passed
to reach it, at Pike's Cape Garlic and in that vicinity. At the head of Harper
and Crooked sloughs the channel runs under the Iowan bluffs to Lansing, Allamakee
Co., Ia., 12Â½ m. from Lynxville. On the Wisconsin side for the same
distance is a remarkably labyrinthic snicarty, whose principal run is called Winneshiek
slough, upon which is Ferryville, Crawford Co., Wis., at or near the
mouth of Sugar cr. The series of creeks which fall into these sloughs is as
follows, in ascending order: Kettle, above Polander hollow; Copper, above
Cumming's hollow; Buck (duplicating a name: see <a href="#Footnote_I-48">last note</a>); the Sugar cr.
just said; and Rush, above Ferryville. The river sweeps under the bold Iowan
headlands, two prominent points of which became known as Cape Garlic and
Cape Winnebago&mdash;one from the alliaceous plant growing there, and the other
from the incident about to be cited; while two of the four streams which fall
in through four breaks on these bluffs were correspondingly called Garlic r. or
Cape Garlic cr., and Winnebago r. or Cape Winnebago cr. Authors differ as
to which is which; I make the following determinations: 1. At the point where
the main channel of the Mississippi divides into Crooked and Harper sloughs,
8 m. below Lansing, and near where Heytman had his landing, a large creek
falls in. This is properly Garlic r.&mdash;the one on which the town of Capoli is
situated. <i>Capoli</i> means Cape Garlic, being a perversion of the F. Cap Ã  L'Ail&mdash;a
phrase that has been peculiarly unlucky at the hands of compositors and
engravers; even on Nicollet's map it stands by accident Cap aÂ´ Lail, though the
eminent geographer himself was un FranÃ§ais de France, whose mother-tongue
was academic. Beltrami, II. p. 197, expands the phrase to Cape Ã  l'Ail Sauvage.
2. Three miles above the mouth of Capoli cr. a rivulet falls in between two eminences;
the lower one of these is present Capoli bluff, formerly Cap Puant or
Cape Winnebago; the upper one is now called Atchafalaga bluff, formerly Cap
Ã  l'Ail or Cape Garlic; the rivulet just said is Pike's Garlic r. 3. At 4Â½
m. higher, through a recess in the highlands falls in the stream now called Village
cr., which Nicollet maps as Cape Winnebago cr. This is the one on
which the town of Village Creek is situated, 3 m. up. Its mouth is exactly a
mile below the mouth of Coon or Clear cr., on which Lansing is situated,
under Mt. Hosmer&mdash;this "mountain" being that part of the bluffs which is
isolated between the two creeks just said to fall in a mile apart. With thus
much by way of geographical determinations, I must leave to someone more
familiar than I am with the local traditions or actual history of the place, to
identify the exact scene of the following incident, given in Keating's Long's Exp.
of 1823, pub. 1824, I. p. 266: "Two remarkable capes or points were observed on
the right bank of the Mississippi below Iowa river; the lower one is designated
by the name of Cape <i>Puant</i>, because at a time when the Sioux and Winnebagoes
(<i>Puants</i>) were about to commence hostilities, a party of the latter set out on an
expedition to invade the territory of the Sioux and take them by surprise; but
these being informed of the design, collected a superior force and lay in ambush
near this place, expecting the arrival of their enemies. As soon as the Winnebagoes
had landed, the Sioux sallied from their hiding-places, pressed upon them
as they lay collected in a small recess between the two capes, drove them into
the river, and massacred the whole party. Garlic cape, just <i>above</i> [italics mine]
this, strikes the voyager by the singularity of its appearance. In shape it represents
a cone cut by a vertical plane passing through its apex and base; its height
is about four hundred feet." I suppose the "small recess" of this recital to be
that between present Capoli (lower) and present Atchafalaga (upper) bluffs,
respectively former Cape Winnebago (lower) and former Cape Garlic (upper)
bluffs.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-50" id="Footnote_I-50" href="#FNanchor_I-50"><span class="label">[I-50]</span></a> La Feuille is a name which Pike rarely, and only by accident, spells correctly.
But in writings of the period it was extremely variable, being found
even as Lefei, Lefoi, Lefoy, La Fye, etc. This French term commonly appears
in English as The Leaf, sometimes Falling Leaf, and is conjecturally a translation
of the native name of the hereditary chiefs of the Kioxa (Kiyuksa) band of
Sioux. This has usually been rendered Wabasha or Wapasha, and explained as
derived from <i>wapa</i>, leaf, and <i>sha</i>, red. In one place Long has Wauppaushaw.
In Riggs and Pond's Dakota dictionary the name is given as Wapahasha, and
etymologized as from <i>wapaha</i>, a standard, and <i>sha</i>, red. In Minn. Hist. Coll.,
I. 2d ed. 1872, p. 370, J. Fletcher Williams surmises the origination of the
name in the chieftainship of the Warpekutes, otherwise Leaf Shooters&mdash;though
why the tribe was so called, and whether the English term is a proper version of
the aboriginal name, seem never to have been satisfactorily shown. Such forms
of the chief's name as Wabashaw and Wapashaw, etc., are common, besides
which there are some odd and rare ones; <i>e. g.</i>, Beltrami, II. p. 180, has:
"The Great Wabiscihouwa, who is regarded as the Ulysses of the whole nation."
Three chiefs named Wabasha are known to us in history. Wabasha I.
was famous during the Revolutionary war. Wabasha II. was his son, and the
latter is the one of whom Pike, Long, Beltrami, and many others speak. He
was already a great chief in Pike's time, who grew in credit and renown with
years. He was seen in 1820 by General Henry Whiting, who describes him as
a small man with a patch over one eye, who nevertheless impressed everyone
with respect, and whose profile was said to resemble that of the illustrious
CondÃ©. "While with us at Prairie du Chien," says Whiting, "he never moved,
or was seen, without his pipe-bearer. His people treated him with reverence.
Unlike all other speakers in council, he spoke sitting, considering, it was said,
that he was called upon to stand only in the presence of his great father at Washington,
or his representatives at St. Louis." He was not a warrior, believing
that Indians could prosper only at peace with one another and with the whites,
and declared that he had never been at war with the latter, though many of his
young men, against his advice, had been led astray in the war of 1812. His
son, Wabasha III., resided at the village below Lake Pepin until 1853, and in
1872 was living on the Niobrara Reservation.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-51" id="Footnote_I-51" href="#FNanchor_I-51"><span class="label">[I-51]</span></a> To go up to the mouth of Upper Iowa r., for the conference with Leaf's
band of Sioux, who received the Expedition with almost touching warmth, as
Pike goes on to narrate. His map letters "Upper Iowa River," and marks
"Sioux Vill." on the S. side near the mouth. Pike's text of 1807, p. 7, has
Jowa: Beltrami has Yahowa in text, Yawowa on map: for other forms see
<a href="#Footnote_I-25">note<sup>25</sup></a>, p. 22. The river is a large one which, with its tributaries, drains a N.
E. portion of Iowa and some adjoining Minnesota land. The river discharges
by a set of sloughs in such intricate fashion that it is not easy to locate its principal
mouth with entire precision, to say nothing of where it was at Pike's visit;
recent hydrographic surveys, on the scale of a mile to the inch, show the largest
opening at a point exactly 2Â½ m. S. of the inter-State line between Iowa and
Minnesota, which runs to the Mississippi on the parallel of 43Â° 30Â´ N., through
the village of New Albin, on Winnebago cr., and cuts through Lost slough.
Assuming this position, which is probably right within a fraction of a mile, Pike
is precisely opposite the place where was fought the decisive battle of Bad Axe,
notable in history as finishing the second Black Hawk war. Black Hawk was
the most celebrated chief during the Sac and Fox war, b. about 1768, at the Sac
vill. near the mouth of Rock r. in Illinois, d. on the Des Moines, in Iowa, Oct.
3d, 1838. In the campaign of 1832 the Indians were defeated on the Wisconsin
r. July 21st, by Colonel Henry Dodge, and again Aug. 2d by General Henry
Atkinson. Zach. Taylor had become colonel of the 1st Infantry Apr. 4th, 1832,
and had his hdqrs. at Fort Crawford, P. du Chien. He moved his forces under
General Atkinson, and caught the Indians opposite the mouth of Upper Iowa r.,
as they were preparing to cross the Mississippi; the battle of Bad Axe was fought,
the hostiles were defeated, and their organization was broken up. Colonel
Taylor returned to P. du Chien with the troops he commanded, and soon afterward
received the formal surrender of the Sac chieftain, whose sagacity was as
great as his courage. Black Hawk was sent by Taylor, with about 60 of his
people, as a prisoner of war to General Winf. Scott, and with some of them
was confined for a while in Fortress Monroe; released June 5th, 1833. The
first stream of any size, on the Wisconsin side, above the scene of action was
named and is still called Bad Axe. A place above Battle cr. and Battle isl., very
near the battle-field, if not actually on the spot, was started by the name of
Victory, which it still bears. This is directly on the river-bank, at the mouth of
a rivulet which makes in there, about a mile below the spot where one Tippet
had his landing. Tippet's place was nearly opposite the Iowa-Minnesota State
line, and 1Â½ m. S. of the lower mouth of Bad Axe r. As the price of their
defeat the S. and F. Inds. were obliged to surrender a large tract of land,
about 9,000 sq. m., along 180 m. of the W. bank of the Mississippi, and,
perhaps, 50 m. broad; this became known as the Scott or the Black Hawk
purchase, and later as the Iowa district; it was attached to the Territory of
Michigan for judicial purposes in 1834, and the separate Territory of Iowa was
made July 4th, 1838.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-52" id="Footnote_I-52" href="#FNanchor_I-52"><span class="label">[I-52]</span></a> By the river channel barely over the Iowa State line into Houston Co.,
Minn., obliquely opposite Tippet's landing, and about a mile below the mouth
of Bad Axe r., which falls in on the Wisconsin side. Pike continues to have
Wisconsin on his right until he crosses the mouth of St. Croix r.</p>

<p class="footnote">I suspect that the <i>Upper</i> Iowa r., which Pike has just left, has a longer historical
record than that with which it is generally credited. Franquelin, 1688,
maps a large river above the Wisconsin and below Root r., thus apparently
in the position of the Upper Iowa. He letters Indians on it as Peoueria and
Tapoueri. Perrot's AyoÃ«s r. seems to be the same, as is certainly the Ioua r. of
Lewis and Clark's map, 1814. Long has Little Ioway r. in 1817, and Upper
Iaway r. in 1823.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-53" id="Footnote_I-53" href="#FNanchor_I-53"><span class="label">[I-53]</span></a> This is not very definite&mdash;perhaps Pike forgot to wind up his watch after
the Sioux affair. But we shall be about right to set him down at Brownsville,
Houston Co., Minn.; this is below Root r., which he passes to-morrow, and
within convenient reach of the place, 3 m. beyond La Crosse, to which he comes
on that rainy day. Starting from the State line, as already said, he first rounds
Bad Axe bend, at the mouth of Bad Axe r., and then comes to the town of
Genoa, 8Â¼ m. above Victoria. Genoa used to be called Bad Axe; but they do
not seem to have fancied the name, or perhaps the Victorians crowed over them,
and told them stories about George Washington and his little hatchet, so it was
changed. Bad Axe r. is also found with the F. name Mauvaise Hache: <i>e. g.</i>,
Beltrami, II. p. 178. A mile above Genoa the river divides in two courses,
inclosing an irregularly oval cluster of islands 6Â½ m. long; that on the Minnesota
side is Raft channel, which runs part of the way under bluffs; the one on
the Wisconsin side, which is or was lately the steamboat way, is Coon, Raccoon,
or Racoon slough, with a creek of these names coming in about its middle,
3 and 2 m. above Britt's and Warner's ldgs., respectively. The hills are some
miles back on this side, with a break where Coon cr. comes in, and so continue
all the way to Prairie La Crosse. Brownsville is at the mouth of Wild
Cat cr., 1Â½ m. above the place where the two courses of the river reunite, or
rather begin to separate; and this town is 21 m. by the river-channel above
Victoria&mdash;for Coon slough is very crooked. Britt's ldg. became the site of a
place called Bergen; and one by the name of Stoddard is on the slough a little
above Coon cr., about opp. Brownsville. The Wisconsin county line between
Vernon and La Crosse comes to the river between Stoddard and Mormon creeks.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-54" id="Footnote_I-54" href="#FNanchor_I-54"><span class="label">[I-54]</span></a> R. aux Racines of the French; Racine or Root r., the latter name now
most used, though in the case of a well-known Wisconsin city the F. word persists
as the name. Nicollet calls it Hokah or Root r., and so does Owen. The
Franquelin map of 1688 marks a certain R. des Arounoues, which some authors
identify with Lahontan's semi-mythical R. Morte or Longue, and refer both to
Root r.; but this is questionable. Long speaks (I. p. 247) of Root r. as having
its Dakotan name Hoka, and being supposed to be the same as the RiviÃ¨re
Long or RiviÃ¨re Morte of Lahontan, I. p. 112, called by Coxe in 1741, p. 19
and p. 63, Mitschaoywa and Meschaouay. He utterly discredits the Baron's
"180 leagues" of this river, as well as his fabulous nations "Eokoros,"
"Essanapes," and "Gnacsitares." Without prejudice to the perennial question,
which it would be a pity to settle now, whether the Baron was a knave or a fool,
or most likely both, it may be observed that Major Long is mistaken in supposing
his Hoka or Root r. to be the one which Lahontan represents himself to
have gone up; for if he went up any real river, that is Cannon r., as Nicollet
urges, and would clinch his argument by calling it Lahontan r.: see beyond.
Hokah, Racine, or Root r.&mdash;to use all three of the sure names&mdash;is a large
stream which runs E. through several of the lower tier of Minnesota counties,
and falls in through Houston Co., 3Â½ m. directly S. of La Crosse, though the
distance is more than this by the winding river-channel. Mormon cr. comes
into the slough on the Wisconsin side opposite Root r., immediately below
La Crosse prairie. The slough on the Minnesota side above Root r. is called
Broken Arrow&mdash;and this, by the way, is connected with a certain small Target
lake; so that no doubt some actual incident gave rise to both these names.
This lake is the outlet of Pine cr.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-55" id="Footnote_I-55" href="#FNanchor_I-55"><span class="label">[I-55]</span></a> Three of Pike's river-miles beyond La Crosse bring him to La Crescent,
Houston Co., Minn., close to the border of Winona Co.&mdash;not that he says he
camped on the W. side, but he would naturally select that side in preference
to the other, where the various outlets of La Crosse and Black rivers make such
a snicarty. La Crescent is curiously so called, apparently in rivalry with La
Crosse, and perhaps by some individual who thought he knew what La Crosse
means, and was minded to suggest by the Turkish emblem that the star of the
new place was in the ascendant and the town bound to grow. Thus far, however,
it has been more of an excrescence from La Crosse than a crescence of
itself. <i>Crosse</i>, in French, does not mean "cross," but the game of hockey,
shinny, or bandy, and the crooked stick or racket with which it is played. Pike
describes the game beyond, under date of <a href="#Page_207">Apr. 20th, 1806</a>. The F. word for
"crescent" is <i>croissant</i>. The beautiful Prairie Ã  la Crosse was so called by the
French because the Indians used to play ball there when they felt safe; and
when the enemy appeared they could scoop holes in it and scuttle into them in
a few minutes. The river which laves this ball-ground on the N. became La
RiviÃ¨re de la Prairie Ã  la Crosse, which we naturally shorten into La Crosse
r. Pike says la Cross and le Cross, usually. I have seen it spelled Crose.
Lewis and Clark's map of 1814 letters "Prairie La Crosse R." Long has in one
place Prairie de la Cross. Featherstonhaugh turns the phrase into Ball Game r.
It was probably by accident that Long once gave it as La Croix r.; for he is
careful in his statements, and his editor, Keating, is scholarly. This slip is particularly
unlucky, as it is liable to cause confusion with St. Croix, name of the
large river higher up on the same side. The city of La Crosse was started on
the edge of the plain, immediately over the river, and gave name to the county
of which it became the seat. Two of the islands which the city faces are Grand
and La Plume, respectively 1Â¼ and Â¾ m. long. Close above La Crosse r.&mdash;in
fact, connected with one of its mouths at the place where the town of North La
Crosse was planted&mdash;is Black r. This has a long history. La Salle speaks of
it as R. Noire and Chabadeba [Beaver], in his letter of Aug. 22d, 1682; R.
Noire appears on Franquelin's map, 1688; Hennepin has it under the Sioux
name Chabedeba or Chabaoudeba, and the like, translated Beaver r. Franqulin
locates a certain Butte d'Hyvernement, or wintering-hill, at the mouth of
R. Noire; Menard and Guerin are said to have ascended the latter in 1661.
The most remarkable things about the mouth of Black r. are the extraordinary
length of its delta and the great changes which this has experienced within
comparatively few years. The waters of Black r., though it is not a very large
stream, have found their way into the Mississippi from La Crosse upward for
12 m. or more. There are now a number of openings, though the principal
one is the lowermost, nearest La Crosse. Nicollet, writing about 1840, gives
this as the "new mouth" of the Sappah or Black r. (Sapah Watpa of the
Sioux), and calls the next one Broken Gun channel. This is rendered by
F. Casse-Fusils in Beltrami, II. p. 178, who recites the gun-breaking incident.
This channel now opens opposite the mouth of Dakota cr., which falls in under
Mineral bluff, at a place called Dakota. The main former debouchment seems
to have been at a point about 12 m. direct above La Crosse, through what is
now known as Hammond's chute. In Pike's time the mouth was evidently
high up, for he does not pass it till the 13th. The present (or recent) channel
is turbid and sloughy for some miles up from its contracted opening into the
Mississippi, reminding one of the similar but more pronounced expansion of
St. Croix r. above its mouth. The width of the delta, or its extent sideways
from the Mississippi, averages between 3 and 4 m., inclusive of a higher piece
of ground it incloses, called Lytle's prairie or terrace; this is 4Â¼ m. long and
20-30 feet above high-water mark; Half Way cr. comes around its lower end.
The vicissitudes of Black r. may be among the reasons why exact identification of
some places about its mouth in the early French writers is not easy. Speaking
with reserve, and ready to stand corrected by anyone who knows more than I do
about it, I do not see why the traditional Butte d'Hyvernement may not have
been Mt. Trempealeau. As for the extent of the Black River basin, this is
long enough to begin in Taylor Co., where waters separate in various directions,
and to run through Clark and Jackson cos.; thence the river separates La
Crosse from Trempealeau Co. till it reaches the town of New Amsterdam;
after which the river enters its delta in La Crosse Co., and the county line runs
5 or 6 m. to the Mississippi on a parallel of latitude.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-56" id="Footnote_I-56" href="#FNanchor_I-56"><span class="label">[I-56]</span></a> From La Crosse to the town of Trempealeau is reckoned 19 m. by the
channel; the mountain is 3 m. further by the same way. Pike was advanced
beyond La Crosse when he started from La Crescent, and his 21 m. no doubt
set him snug under the famous hill whose F. name snagged him when he
reached it. This is not the mountain which "deceives" (<i>trompe</i>) in the water,
as by mirage or reflection of itself reversed; but one which rises so abruptly
from the water's edge that it seems to bathe, or at least to soak its feet, in the
water, and was therefore called by the French la Montagne qui Trempe Ã  l'Eau&mdash;a
clumsy phrase which we have reduced to Mt. Trempealeau, Mt. Trombalo,
and various other terms not less curious. There is a notable assortment of
names along the river. On decamping and crossing the bounds of Houston Co.
into Winona Co., Minn., Pike comes to the Rising Sun&mdash;though his course is
about N., and we are not informed whether this name advertises a certain stove-polish,
or is meant to throw in the shade both the Turkish crescent and the
Christian cross. E. of Rising Sun is Minnesota isl., on the Wisconsin side.
A few miles further is a place in Minnesota by the Teutonic name of Dresbach,
at the head of Dresbach's isl.; 1Â½ m. further is a town with the Siouan name
Dakota; while E. of these (across the Black r. delta in Wis.) is a place called
Onalaska, suggestive of Captain Cook's voyage to the Aleutian isls. One
Winter used to have his ldg. on the Wis. side, 2Â½ m. above Dakota, and in
the vicinity of the place where Black r. debouched in Pike's time&mdash;Winter's
ldg. being a singular verbal coincidence, almost like a pun upon the old name
of hibernation (Butte d'Hyvernement), which appears on the earlier pages of
Mississippian history. At 3 m. above Winter's ldg. stands Richmond, which
was established under Queen's bluff on the Minn. side. Both of these names
suggest English Colonial history of the times when a certain country was named
Virginia&mdash;certainly not to quiz one of the greatest women who ever graced
a crown, but to emphasize a diplomatic euphemism. The "highest hill" in
this vicinity is Queen's bluff, also known as Spirit rock&mdash;not that called Kettle
hill by Long in 1817; its elevation was determined by Nicollet to be 531 feet,
but was reduced to 375 feet by later measurements. The town of Trempealeau,
in the Wis. co. of that name, is midway between Richmond and the
mountain; but before Pike reached the latter, he passed on his left the site of
Lamoille, Minn., built under the bluff, about 300 feet high, between two creeks
whose names are Trout and Cedar. It is really wonderful how much history is
hidden&mdash;or revealed&mdash;in mere names. Personal and local words are the most
concrete facts of history. If, for example, those which appear in this paragraph
were set forth at full length in proper historical perspective, we should have a
perfect panorama of scenes and incidents along 20 m. of the river for 200 yrs.
The myrionymous molehill on the river, which has been dignified by the name of
a mountain because there are no mountains to speak of in Wisconsin or Minnesota,
and which has been belittled by a set of phrases so absurd that it could not
be further ridiculed if one were to call it Mt. Trombonello, or Mt. Trump Low,
or Mt. Tremble Oh, or Mt. Soak-your-feet-in-mustard-water-and-go-to-bed-oh,
has not only conferred titles on a town and a county in Wisconsin, but also on
the river which washes its foot, and which is known by one of the most unique
circumlocutory phrases to be found in geographical terminology: La RiviÃ¨re de
la Montagne qui Trempe Ã  l'Eau, of the French; River of the Mountain, etc.,
Pike; Mont. q. t. Ã  l'E. r., Owen; Mountain Island r., Nicollet; Bluff
Island r., Long&mdash;and so on through all the chimes that can be rung out of
paraphrase. It is now usually called Trempealeau r., and forms the boundary
between this and Buffalo cos. The Sioux name of the mountain is rendered
Minnay Chonkahah, or Bluff in the Water, by Featherstonhaugh. A more
frequent form of this is Minneshonka. The Winnebago name is given as Hay-me-ah-chan
or Soaking mountain in Hist. Winona Co., 1883. The island on
which the mountain rests has a corresponding series of names.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike passed to-day the place where was once situated an old French fort,
which has lately been unearthed alongside the Chic., Burl. and N. R. R. The
site is on the S. half of the S. E. quarter of Section 20, Township 18 N.,
Range 9 W., 1Â¾ m. above the village, and 1Â½ m. below the mountain, of
Trempealeau. It was discovered by T. H. Lewis, July, 1885, and by him
examined in Nov., 1888, and again in Apr., 1889: see his article, Mag. Amer.
Hist., Sept., 1889, and separate, 8vo. p. 5, with three cuts, and postscript dated
Feb. 22d, 1890. See also T. H. Kirk, Mag. Amer. Hist., Dec., 1889, article
entitled, "Fort Perrot, Wisconsin, established in 1685, by Nicholas Perrot," with
reference to the evasive Butte d'Hyvernement, or wintering-hill of the Franquelin
map, 1688. The separate of Mr. Lewis' article is entitled, "Old French
Post at Trempeleau, Wisconsin." "Fort Perrot," as a name of this establishment,
must not be confounded with the one often so called on Lake Pepin.</p>

the French as La Prairie Aux Ailes (pronounced O'Zell) or the Wing's prairie,

see <a href="#Footnote_I-58">next note</a>. Long, <i>l. c.</i>, calls it "an extensive lawn," and notes the
situation on it in 1817 of an Indian village, whose chief he calls Wauppaushaw

names it Wing prairie.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-58" id="Footnote_I-58" href="#FNanchor_I-58"><span class="label">[I-58]</span></a> From his camp in the vicinity of Trempealeau and Lamoille towns, a little
below the Mountain which, etc., Pike makes it 21 m. to-day and 25 m. to-morrow
to a point opp. the mouth of Buffalo r. He is therefore to-day a little
short of halfway between Trempealeau and Alma. From Trempealeau to
Fountain City is 20 m. by the channel; from Fountain City to Alma is 22 m.
Pike camps to-day at Fountain City, Buffalo Co., Wis., immediately below
the mouth of Eagle cr. The island at the head of which he breakfasted,
and where Frazer's boats came up, was No. 75, which separates the Homer
chute, also called Blacksmith slough, from the rest of the Mississippi. Though
narrow, this is, or lately was, the steamboat channel. Opposite is town of
Homer, Winona Co., Minn., under Cabin bluff (most probably Kettle hill of
Long). At 1Â½ m. above Homer, on the same side, is the town of Minneopa.
Here the bluffs recede from the river; here Pike left his boats for an excursion
on the hills. The "Prairie Le Aisle," which he first crossed, is in Burris valley.
The highest point of the hills which he ascended for his prospect is called the
Sugarloaf. Standing there to-day, we overlook Winona, seat of the county, and
at the foot of the hills between us and the town is Lake Winona, nearly 2 m.
long, discharging into Burris Valley cr. Looking E. from the Sugar-loaf,
down-river, we perceive that the Mountain which, etc., is simply a point of the
bluffs which stands isolated in the delta of Trempealeau r. To our left of it as
we look, and beyond it eastward, stretches the high prairie between the delta
just said and that of Black r. Rambling further along the hills back of Winona
we come to Minnesota City, at a break in the bluffs through which a rivulet
finds its way into Crooked slough. From this spot Fountain City is in full
view, 3Â½ air-miles off on a course N. by E., under Eagle bluff, on the other
side of the river. A portion of these bluffs is probably that called Tumbling
Rock by Forsyth in 1819. We could keep along the hills till they strike the
river about 5 m. further. But Mr. Frazer is anxious to get back to the boats;
very likely Bradley and Sparks are also. So we descend into the bottom from
Minnesota City, flounder across some sloughs, and on reaching the W. bank of
the Mississippi, we signal to our men to come over in a canoe and ferry us to
Fountain City.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-59" id="Footnote_I-59" href="#FNanchor_I-59"><span class="label">[I-59]</span></a> Fountain City to Alma, 22 m. Camp opp. Alma, in Wabasha Co., Minn.,
amid the intricacies of the Zumbro delta. For many miles above and below
this place&mdash;from Chippewa r. down to Winona, say 40 m.&mdash;the Father of
Waters, like the father of Shem, Ham, and Japhet, if we can credit the chronicles
of that ancient mariner, gets himself in very bad form. He reels along as
if he would like to take both sides of the bluffs at once. Great skill has been
shown by engineers in trying to steer him in the way he should go; much money
has been spent in throwing out jetties like friends at each elbow of the staggering
patriarch, to mend his ways; some of his worst lurches have been dammed
as a matter of necessity, and all of them have been otherwise objurgated as
a matter of course by every steamboat captain. The late General G. K.
Warren, who was intrusted with the responsible duty of surveying the river
with reference to the improvement of navigation, makes a most accurate
observation in his preliminary Rep., Ex. Doc. No. 57, 2d Sess. 39th Congr.,
p. 19: "It is often remarked, 'What a slight thing will cause a change of the
river.' But it is erroneous to infer from this that it is easy to make it change
as we wish. Effects are often accumulating unobserved during a state of
unstable equilibrium. A slight cause then disturbs this, and marked changes
take place. But it is exceedingly superficial to attribute the whole effect to this
last cause." In consequence of the great changes in the river, both natural
and artificial, since the days of Pike, we must not assume the present or quite
recent details to be those of Pike's time; nor should we presume to speak censoriously
regarding the identification of such things as Carver's supposed fortifications
of 1766-67. Within the bounds of the solid, if not eternal hills, through
which the water has excavated its trough, we have the great river safe enough.
But these bounds are some miles apart, and between them all is in the "unstable
equilibrium" of which the eminent engineer just cited speaks. The result is
incessant shiftiness or shiftlessness, not only as regards the sloughy bottoms and
snicarties themselves, but in respect of the sands which accumulate in various
places and form banks or terraces which sometimes take such shapes as to be
easily mistaken for artificial mounds. The cardinal principle of sound
archÃ¦ology is to assume every mound to be a natural formation until it is
proven to be the work of man. One of the most notable historical instances in
point is that of the "fortifications" at Bon Homme, on the Missouri r., which
deceived even so accurate an observer as Captain Clark: see L. and C., ed.
1893, p. 103, <i>seq.</i>, and pl. Some of the present or quite recent water-ways in
the vicinity of Fountain City are those known as Pap chute, Betsy, Haddock,
and Rollingstone sloughs, Horseshoe bend, and Fountain City bay, into which
Eagle cr. falls, under Eagle bluff. The hills then come to the river on the
Minnesota side, and so continue past Mt. Vernon to Minneiska. One of the
boldest of these headlands is called Chimney Rock. Some have an altitude of
450 feet. On the other side the bluffs recede above Fountain City, break to
give passage to Eagle c., start again about 2Â½ m. from the river, and thence
upward approach gradually till they strike the river at Alma. The space
between these hills and the river bottom is partly filled by a sand terrace for
about 9 m., with an average width of a mile. On the edge of the upper one of
these banks is Buffalo City, 2 m. above which a place was started by the name
of Belvidere. The boundary between Winona and Wabasha cos. comes on
a parallel of latitude to the river at Minneiska, a town named for the river at
whose mouth it is situated, under high bluffs, facing the lower part of Summerfield
or Summerfield's isl., which is 4 m. long. This river is Pike's "Lean
Clare," clearly by typographical error, as he elsewhere has Riviere l'Eau Clair,
almost right, and correctly translates the phrase by Clear r. and Clear Water r.
This is also White Water r. of Long and others, at present the usual alternative
name of Minneiska r.; Miniskon r., Nicollet; Miniskah r., Owen; Minneska
r., Warren; and so on with the forms of the Indian word. Clear r.
comes into the bottom between the Minneiska bluffs and a certain isolated hill
to the northward, in the vicinity of which Clear r. is still or was lately connected
with one of the lowest sluices of the Zumbro r. This last is what Pike
calls riviere Embarrass (river Embaras, ed. 1807, p. 13). The French named
it RiviÃ¨re aux Embarras, from the difficulty they found in attempting to
navigate it, and we have made Zumbro out of this embarrassment. Nicollet
calls it Wazi Oju r., in which he is followed by Owen and others. Its delta
extends practically from Minneiska to Wabasha, a distance of 20 m. by the
Mississippi channel. The opening which Pike takes as the mouth is the lower
one, as he passes it before camping opp. Alma. This delta incloses one long,
narrow sand terrace, continuous for 9 m., and several similar but smaller banks,
as well as an extensive system of sloughs and islands. The West Newton chute
and accompanying islands are among these; and Pike's camp was at the head
of this chute, directly opposite Alma and the mouth of Buffalo r. The history
of this river dates back to 1680 at least: R. des B&oelig;ufs, Hennepin, map, 1683;
River of Wild Bulls, Hennep., Engl. transl.; B&oelig;ufs R., Lahontan, map;
Buffaloe or Buffalo r., Pike, Long, Nicollet, Owen, etc.; Beef r., Warren and
others; <i>cf.</i> also, R. de Bon Secours of the early F. writers, whence Good
Help r. by translation. Some connect the two names, as R. des B&oelig;ufs ou de
Bon Secours, as if the supply of beef had been a great relief. There were
plenty of buffaloes on this part of the Mississippi in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, and indeed down to some early years of our own. But
they were exterminated or driven off soon after Fort St. Anthony (Snelling) was
built in 1819. Fort St. Antoine appears in earliest connection with the river.
Its own mouth has no doubt been fixed since prehistoric times by the solid
Alma bluffs around which it sweeps into the Mississippi. But the delta of
Chippewa r., whose main discharge is by a contracted opening 9Â½ direct
miles above the mouth of Buffalo r., extends between these two points, and is
meandered by the intricacies of Beef slough, which such competent professional
opinion as Warren's pronounces to have once divided the main Chippewa:
Ex. Doc. No. 57, etc., p. 13. "The Chippeway river had a large lateral gorge
like that of the St. Croix to fill up before reaching the valley of the Mississippi,
and it now joins the Mississippi by a very complete set of delta streams, beginning
about 15 miles above its mouth. There was a time when the mouth now
known as Beef slough was about equal to the main Chippeway. In their
growth each kept along the bluffs or sides of the gorge they were filling up,
raising their immediate banks and leaving a depression between them. The
bank which the present Mississippi finally put across the delta was not then
there, and large trees grew up on this intermediate space. The delta having
finally reached the Mississippi, the water was more rapidly raised in Lake
Pepin. This intermediate space was closed up on its third side by the new
forming bank of the Mississippi, and became a lake. The trees in it then
perished, and their submerged parts, preserved by the water, remain standing
in the lake at this time [July 31st, 1865]. This place is known as Stump lake,
and this name it bore among the aboriginal Sioux (Chan-poksa-m'dÃ©). The
lower of these two delta mouths became obstructed and dammed up by the new
forming banks of the Mississippi; the lower part of it then filled up, and it
finally broke through its own banks into Stump lake, so that it now issues
therefrom in several much obstructed channels, almost entirely useless to
navigation.... The Trempealeau and Black rivers repeat the operation of the
Chippeway on a smaller scale, the Wisconsin probably on a greater, other
streams doing the same in proportion to their size." In this view of Beef slough
as an obstructed channel of the Chippewa, Beef or Buffalo r. is simply an
affluent of the Chippewa, precisely as the Minneiska is of the Zumbro, or La
Crosse of Black r.; and other such cases of originally distinct rivers falling into
the Mississippi as one by their deltopoetic processes could easily be cited.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-60" id="Footnote_I-60" href="#FNanchor_I-60"><span class="label">[I-60]</span></a> "Grand Encampment" is a phrase in use since Carver's Travels first
appeared. Carver first came to Lake Pepin Nov. 1st, 1766. Those who wish
to verify the fact will find it on p. 34 of the Phila. ed. of 1796, which is commoner
and therefore more accessible than any of the earlier ones; the London
princeps, 1778, is a rare book; the place is p. 54 of this ed. On p. 35, Carver
says the place was "some miles below Lake Pepin." This left the location in the
air, especially as he does not say which side of the river; and various authors
have raised such a fog about it that we might be excused if we failed to find it
anywhere. By Pike as above, the place is between Buffalo r. and Chippewa
r.; he starts late, noons on the spot, and gets into Lake Pepin at
dusk. On his return voyage, Apr. 15th, 1806, he stops at the place; he
makes it on the right (west) bank, 9 m. below Lake Pepin. When Long comes
by, in 1823, his boat-party camps opposite the mouth of Buffalo r., just as
Pike did yesterday; on the 30th of June they find themselves "a few miles"
below L. Pepin, and much concerned to discover Carver's "fortifications": see
Keating, I. pp. 276-78. The upshot of their long discussion is the conclusion
that Carver did really see what he says he saw, but that the works he described
were not at the Grand Encampment, where they found no fortifications.
But this is clearly a non sequitur, or a lucus a non, or a petitio principii, or an
argumentum ad hominem, or whatever may be the logical definition of an
illogical syllogism. It misses the point. The question is not one of identifying
Carver's locality; the question is whether what he saw there was an artificial
work or a natural formation. The place can be pointed out with the
point of a pin stuck through the map, provided the topography has not changed
too much for that during the century; for the point which now points to
Carver's location is Point Teepeeota of the U.Â S. survey chart. The point
above, at which Major Long's boat-party landed an hour or two later that day,
and "which appeared to correspond with the description" of Carver's place,
though "their search here was likewise unsuccessful" (p. 278), is the present
site of Wabasha&mdash;the place where Nicholas Perrot is thought to have landed
in 1683, and built a log fort, the first thing of the kind in all that country,
afterward marked on some maps as Fort Perrot. Teepeeota pt. is the
projecting end of the long narrow sand-drift or sand terrace already mentioned
as extending 9 m. or more in the delta of the Zumbro; it strikes the
Mississippi immediately below the Middle mouth of the Zumbro, and in
fact determines the position of that opening. Teepeeota pt. is 4Â½ m. direct
above Alma, somewhat more than 5 m. by the channel; it is 3 m. direct below
Wabasah, a little more by the channel; it is 6 m. below the upper mouth of
Chippewa r., say 7 by the channel. The Indian name would be more correctly
rendered Tipiotah&mdash;<i>tipi</i> meaning a lodge or dwelling (such as is called "wigwam"
in novels, but seldom so on the spot) and the rest of the word denoting
multitude; the paper-town there, called Tepeeotah City, went up in smoke, 1859.
The island off Teepeeota pt., but a little lower down, is now called Grand
Encampment isl. Of the accuracy of this identification I do not see how there
can be any question, though time has modified the contour details in the course
of nature, as well as in the course of the engineering work done there of late
years. These fortifications of the river against its own sands are doubtless the
only ones of any magnitude that have ever been made on the spot, before or
since Carver; though there was nothing to hinder the Sioux from scooping
holes in the sand-drift and scuttling into them when the Chippewas came in
sight, as we know they did at Prairie La Crosse and elsewhere. Under these
circumstances, I think the gentlemen of Major Long's party were as unjust to
themselves in doubting their own identifications (in which they were supported
by Hart, Rolette, and others who knew about the place), as they were to Carver
in saying, p. 277: "No gentleman of the party would be willing to ascribe to
Carver a scrupulous adherence to truth, (personal observation having convinced
them all of the many misrepresentations contained in his work)." If this is
meant to charge Carver with willful misrepresentation, I think it is unjust as
well as ungenerous. Carver mistook a natural for an artificial work&mdash;so did
William Clark, to the extent of drawing one to a scale and describing it in the
terms of military science&mdash;so have done many professional archÃ¦ologists. Carver
made mistakes, like the rest of us; he was often loose about distances, dimensions,
and such things; he believed more things that were told him than a less
honest and more wary wayfarer would have taken to be true; but I think that
he drew a short bow for so long a journey, had no occasion to deceive anyone
but himself, and always intended to tell the truth as it seemed to him&mdash;in short,
I do not see how his good faith can be seriously questioned. I accept Carver's
statements, as I do those of Pike, Long, and other honest persons, for what
they may prove to be worth.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-61" id="Footnote_I-61" href="#FNanchor_I-61"><span class="label">[I-61]</span></a> R. des Sauteurs, etc., of the French, <i>i. e.</i>, River of the Chippewas, with
all the uncounted variations of the latter word, from such forms as Ouchipouwaictz
to the present Chippewa, Chippeway, or Chipeway. Pike's 1807 text
has Sautiaux r., p. 13. Beltrami has Cypewais in text, Cypoway on map.
Present usage among geographers favors two <i>p's</i> and no <i>y</i>; the ethnologists
incline rather to Ojibwa. This one of the major tributaries of the Mississippi
now falls in by its main upper mouth 1Â½ m. below the end of Lake Pepin, from
the N., nearly at a right angle; it is somewhat bottle-nosed&mdash;that is, with a contracted
orifice of a turgid body of water, though the dilation is not so great as
in the case of the St. Croix. The general character of the delta has been
already discussed in connection with Beef slough. Pike has this on his right
all the way from Alma to L. Pepin. On his left he passes Grand Encampment
isl. and dines near Point Teepeeota, already described as the point of that sandbank
I should wish to call Carver's Terrace. He next comes to Wabasha, seat
of the Minnesota county of that name, so called from the celebrated Sioux
chief of whom we read much in Long, I. p. 272, and elsewhere; his name is
there spelled Wapasha, and his village was at that time not on this spot, but
lower down (Winona). The site of Wabasha duplicates the situation at Point
Teepeeota; it is in the Zumbro delta, below the Upper Zumbro outlet, on the
point of a sand-bank identical in formation with Carver's Terrace, though much
smaller&mdash;under 3 m. in length, and less than a mile wide. Passing Wabasha,
Pike comes 2 m. to the town now called Read's Landing, at the uppermost
point of the Zumbro floodplain, almost opposite the mouth of Chippewa r.
Nicollet marks "Roques," <i>i. e.</i>, Augustin Rocque's trading-house, in about the
right position, <i>i. e.</i> at present site of Wabasha, where Rocque's old chimney was
evidence in 1884. This person, whose last name might be spelled with a <i>g</i> as
well as his first, very likely lived on more than one spot in the course of his
career. Featherstonhaugh informs us that "Ruque's" Indian name was
Wajhustachay, and that his house stood on the edge of a high prairie, 50 feet
from the water, at S. E. end of L. Pepin, right bank, opp. Chip. r.; which fits
in only with the site of present Read's Landing. Here the C., M. and St. P. R.
R. bridged the Miss. r. in '82 (Act of Congr., Mar. 28th, '82). As indicated in
an earlier note, the Chippewa is one of the main waterways between the Mississippi
and the Great Lakes; the connection will be more particularly noted hereafter.
Carver went this way in June or July, 1867, after he had wintered up the St. Peter.
For some distance from its mouth this river separates Pepin from Buffalo Co.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-62" id="Footnote_I-62" href="#FNanchor_I-62"><span class="label">[I-62]</span></a> Apparently a misprint: Alma to Read's Landing, near the foot of Lake
Pepin, 12 m. by the crooked channel; thence to Wakouta, near the head of
the lake, is only 25 m., and Pike is not yet halfway through. He says
himself that he made 3 m. further to Sandy pt., and then 18 m. up to Cannon
r. He undoubtedly ran for shelter from the gale at or near Stockholm,
Pepin Co., Wis. The channel is or has lately been along the Minnesota side
to Lake City, crossing obliquely to the other side in passing Stockholm, then
leaving for the Minn. side to reach Point No Point, and so on up this side to
Wakouta, Red Wing, and Cannon r. "<i>Le lac est petit, mais il est malin</i>":
I faithfully copy this venerable Jo Miller, and am ready to agree that the lake
is not big, but bad. It is reckoned about 21 m. long, averaging about 2Â½ broad;
thus it is merely a dilation of the Mississippi, like that of the St. Croix and
some other Mississippian tributaries, though on a larger scale. The Chippewa
r. was concerned in the formation of Lake Pepin, and the two have had
some reciprocal effect. General Warren's opinion may be here cited, Ex. Doc.
No. 57, 1866-67, p. 11: "In order to better understand the formation of the
present bottom-land valley, and comprehend the existing state of things, we
must go back to the time when, by the elevation of the continent above the
ocean, the present rivers, like the Wisconsin and Chippeway, began to flow into
the channel formed by the present Mississippi bluffs. As soon as the sediment
brought down by their waters had filled up the lateral chasm by which they
joined the Mississippi, this sediment would begin to obstruct the flow of the
Mississippi water, force its channel to the opposite side, and narrow and dam
it back till the water gained sufficient force to carry the sediment down the
valley. The continual sorting out of this sediment would leave the heavier
particles behind, so that this bar would continually increase in elevation and
form a lake above. There are evidences of the effect of the Wisconsin in
making such a dam in the neighborhood of Prairie du Chien, also by other
affluents above their mouths, which lakes have since been filled up. In the
case of the Chippeway and Lake Pepin this effect still remains, the affluents
above the Chippeway not having been able to fill up the lake which was
formed. It seems almost impossible to doubt that this is the origin of Lake
Pepin, and there are evidences in the shape of the sand and boulder spits along
the Mississippi bluffs above Lake Pepin, such as are only formed now in it and
Lake St. Croix, which indicate that the lake formerly extended up much higher
than now.... The river now enters Lake Pepin by three principal mouths, and
the land of the delta gently slopes down to and under the water. It has
advanced very slowly, if at all, since first visited by white men. The largest
sized cottonwood trees, dying of old age, are found on the islands within
two miles of the head of the lake. The small willows on the low and extreme
points seem of an almost uniform size and age; and are small more, perhaps,
from the unfavorable condition in which they are placed than from want of
time to grow since the land was formed. The bottom in the shoal places at
the head of Lake Pepin is composed of soft mud, and not of sand. It seems
probable that nearly all the other islands of the Mississippi were formed in
similar lakes by advancing deltas, until finally the lakes were filled up. Lake
Pepin has almost no current, and deepens gradually down to near the point of
entrance of the Chippeway, and then rapidly shoals and narrows to form again
the flowing river." Lake Pepin is curved on itself, more so than the old-fashioned
Italic letter <i>Å¿</i>, there being a bend in the middle reach which is oblique between
the straight and approximately parallel reaches at the two ends&mdash;say W. N. W.
and E. S. E., then N. and S., then nearly W. and E. The lake nearly fills
the space between the bluffs in which it is embedded, but there are several
pieces of arable bottom-land in places where the bluffs recede, furnishing the
sites of a corresponding number of settlements, mostly at points where creeks
or brooks fall in between gaps in the hills. Such are Pepin and Stockholm,
Pepin Co., Wis.; Maiden Rock City and Bay City, Pierce Co., Wis.; Lake
City, Wabasha Co., Minn.; Florence, Frontenac, and Wakouta or Wacouta,
Goodhue Co., Minn. Maiden Rock City is under the line of bluffs, about 400
feet high, to several of which the Winona legend attaches; but this town is at
the mouth of Rush cr., and thus nearly 5 m. by the railroad above that bluff
to which the names of Maiden's Rock, Maiden's Head, and Lover's Leap more
particularly belong. This is directly opposite Sandy point, and only about 2 m.
by rail above the village of Stockholm; being that one of the series of quite
similar bluffs which has a remarkable vertical escarpment, at a point where
there is little room to spare for the track between the talus at its foot and the
lake shore. A good view is obtained as the cars recede from it. Rush cr. is
mapped both by Pike and by Nicollet, without name; it seems to be that called
Porcupine-Quill cr. by Schoolcraft, and is perhaps Marchessau r. of Featherstonhaugh.
A similar stream, also mapped by Pike and by Nicollet, without
name, and now known as Pine or Mill Pine cr., falls in 1Â½ m. below Rush cr.
Three other small streams, known as Bogus cr., Lost cr., and Roaring r., fall in
below Stockholm on the Wisconsin side; on which side, near the head of the
lake, at the place called Bay City, is Isabel cr. (the Clear Water cr. of Nicollet,
and perhaps the Rocher Rouge r. of Featherstonhaugh). On the Minnesota
side a creek falls in below and another above Lake City; Wells cr. (the Sandy
Point cr. of Pike, and the Sand Point r. of Nicollet), falls in at the point
indicated by these names, a mile or more below Frontenac; while at Wacouta
we find a stream mapped by Nicollet without name, formerly called Bullard's
and now known as Ida cr. The most prominent part of the Minnesota shore,
where the channel sweeps around the convexity of the bold headland, is fittingly
called Point No Point&mdash;as the up-bound passenger discovers when the boat
rounds it. This is immediately above Frontenac, opp. Maiden Rock City, and
about the junction of the middle with the upper reach of the lake. This body
of water is between two States and four counties. The line between Pepin and
Pierce cos., Wis., strikes it at or near Maiden Rock City; that between Wabasha
and Goodhue, Minn., comes to the lake below Frontenac, about Lake City.</p>

<p class="footnote">Lake Pepin is commonly said to have been "discovered by Hennepin" in
1680. This statement is exactly one-third right and two-thirds wrong, and
does a double injustice, because it ignores two of the three white men who were
simultaneously on the spot. These were: 1. Michael Accault, the bourgeois
or leader of the party, who afterward flourished under the style of Le Sieur
d'Accault, d'Acau, d'Ako, Dacan, etc. 2. His man Antoine Auguelle, commonly
called Le Picard, or Picard du Gay. 3. His ecclesiastical functionary
Louis Hennepin, a monk of the Franciscan order, whom La Salle got rid of by
sending him along with Accault and Auguelle, when this Chaas trading-party
started from Fort CrÃ¨vec&oelig;ur on the Illinois r., Feb. 29th, 1680; they reached
the Miss. r. at the mouth of the Illinois, Mar. 7th, 1680, and came to Lake
Pepin in June of that year. It is a pity that the reverend father's vanity, servility,
and envy prevented him from sticking to his ghostly trade; but he was
ambitious of authorship, like many another religious worldling, and jealous of
La Salle. So he set about a book for the glory of a trinity composed of Louis
Hennepin, Louis XIV., and God. It has made much trouble for geographers
and historians, who would willingly have waited for all the information that it
contains till this should have been imparted by some less bigoted, less bombastic,
and more veracious chronicler than this Recollect priest, who recollected
a good many things that never happened, and forgot some of those that did
occur. Hennepin is the able philologist who discovered that the Indians called
their solar deity by the name of the then King of France, and who followed
up this discovery by naming the whole country Louisiana. He is the same
unscrupulous courtier who represents the king's arms to have been cut in the
bark of an oak west of Lac des Assenipoils, ca. lat. 60Â° N.: see his map, place
marked "Armes du Roy telle quel<sup>le</sup> sont grauÃ©e sur l'escorce d'vn Chesne a
lendroit marquÃ©&mdash;A". The tree may be there yet, but the monk never was.
Lahontan's fables are entertaining, like La Fontaine's; Hennepin's are a
bore. When this little Louis is not wheedling the great Louis, he is apt to be
whining; he was troubled with gumboils, from dental caries, and did not
always remember the excellent injunction he received from Father Gabriel&mdash;<i>viriliter
age et comfortetur cor tuum</i>; which an Englishman might freely render,
"Be a man and keep your courage up." This missionary lachrymosely
named the lake, to which Accault, Auguelle, and himself were taken by the
Indians, Lac des Pleurs, a phrase which appears in Engl. transls. of his book as
Lake of Tears, "which we so named," as Shea's text reads, p. 198, "because
the Indians who had taken us, wishing to kill us, some of them wept the whole
night, to induce the others to consent to our death"&mdash;<i>hinc illÃ¦ lacrymÃ¦</i>. Hennepin,
by the way, says further, <i>ibid.</i>: "Half a league below the Lake of
Tears, on the south side, is Buffalo river." This would make R. aux B&oelig;ufs =
Chippewa r.: see <a href="#Footnote_I-59">note<sup>59</sup></a>, p. 58, for some bearings on the case. The obscurity
of the origin of the name Lake Pepin has not been cleared up, so far as I
know. Lesueur came here Sept. 14th, 1700, and "Pepin" is found in La Harpe's
MS. relation of Lesueur's journey of July 12th-Dec. 13th, 1700. It is
unlikely that this name, by whomever given, was bestowed with direct reference
to any person of the Carlovingian dynasty; they were all dead and gone
ages before the lake was discovered, when nobody but historical researchers
took any interest in those defunct monarchs. St. Croix's and St. Pierre's
rivers were certainly named for contemporaneous individuals, and so probably
was Lake Pepin. There were a number of Frenchmen by the name of Pepin,
Papin, etc., in the country in later years, and some one or more of them
may have come before 1700. Carver first came here Nov. 1st, 1766; he notes
the remains of an old F. factory, "where it is said Capt. St. Pierre resided."
Old Ft. St. Antoine may have been on the lake rather than at the mouth of
R. des B&oelig;ufs ou de Bon Secours; and the lake was once called Lac de Bon
Secours, or Bonsecours, a phrase which has been translated Lake Good Help
and Lake Relief. Fort Beauharnois was built on the lake, after Sept. 17th, 1727,
when La Perriere du Boucher landed on Pointe au Sable or elsewhere; the
exact site is unknown. This was an extensive and substantial structure, and was
named in honor of the then Governor of Canada; it included a mission-house
which the ecclesiastical functionaries of Boucher's outfit called St. Michael, after
an archangel of that denomination. This was the fourth French establishment;
the other three having been Fort L'Huillier, 1700, built by Lesueur, on the
Blue Earth r., a branch of St. Pierre's; the fort on Isle PelÃ©e, below Hastings,
by Lesueur also, in 1695; and the fort below the foot of Lake Pepin, at or near
present Wabasha, built by Perrot, 1683.</p>

1807 has Mordock Cameron, p. 59 and p. 64: see also L. and C., ed. 1893,

Voyage, etc., I. 1847, p. 314, speaks at length, and whose death in 1811
is given as follows: "Passed a place on the right bank [of St. Pierre's r.,
above the Waraju] where Milor [F.'s voyageur] buried his bourgeois, a Mr.
Cameron, in 1811. He was an enterprising, sagacious Scotchman who had
amassed a good deal of property by trafficking with the Indians;... and
whilst upon one of his expeditions he was taken ill in his canoe, was landed,
and died in the woods." Fgh. does not hint at foul play here; for the suspicions
in the case, see Long, as cited in my L. and C. Cameron was buried
on a bluff near Lac qui Parle, the lake where his trading-post was, and "Cameron's
grave" has continued to be an identified spot from that day to this.
Cameron's name appears as that of one of the four witnesses to Pike's Sioux
treaty of Sept. 23d on one of the manuscript copies of that document before me.
The "Milor" mentioned here was a Canadian French half-breed who became
very well known as a resident of Mendota, Minn., where he died about 1860,
"after a long life full of adventure and daring exploits," as J. F. Williams
says, Minn. Hist. Coll., I. 2d. ed. 1872, p. 375.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-65" id="Footnote_I-65" href="#FNanchor_I-65"><span class="label">[I-65]</span></a> Those of a sentimental turn who may like to have the full-rounded legend
of the maiden Winona will find the romance related in a scholarly yet sympathetic
vein by Prof. Keating, in Long of 1823, pub. 1824, I. pp. 280-85.
Beltrami, II. p. 183, calls the girl OholoaÃ¯tha, her lover Anikigi, comparing the
pair to the muse of Mitylene and Phaon. Whether the tragic event is fact or
fancy is another question I see no use of raising. There is no inherent improbability
in the case; any girl could have thrown herself over the rock with
more ease than she had climbed it for that purpose, and suicide is not less
frequent among squaws than various other peoples of both sexes. In the
case of Indian women the most usual causes are said to be grief, anger, and
revenge, though in some cases the suicidal resolve is more deliberate, and
rather a matter of social etiquette or of a religious code than of emotional
insanity. I understand that hanging is the customary method of taking one's
self off; and that the smallest tree which will answer the purpose is preferred,
because it is an article of belief that the ghost thus discarnated must
drag the instrument of death about for a period, and a woman naturally prefers
to lighten the load as much as possible. Supposing Winona to have
taken the fatal leap, it is reasonable to infer from the faith in such affairs
that she is there yet, chained to the rock like another Andromeda; for the
bluff is too big for her to budge an inch, even with the assistance of a possible
Perseus. There is unimpeachable precedent for her performance in
the classics, not entirely dissociated from the name and fame of the gifted
poetical archetÃ¦ra Sappho; and rocks reputed to be the scenes of lovers' leaps
abound in history and geography.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-66" id="Footnote_I-66" href="#FNanchor_I-66"><span class="label">[I-66]</span></a> That much-named river, whereto hangs a tale of great length. Pike here
has the right name of it, though it is now usually called Cannon r., by perversion
of the French RiviÃ¨re aux Canots: Cano, Canot, Canon, Canow r. of
various writers; Riviere au Canon, Canoe r., Cannon r., Pike, <i>passim</i>; Canon r.,
Long's map; Eamozindata or High Rock r., Long's text, 1824, I. p. 263; Inyan
Bosndata r., Natural Obelisk r., Standing Rock r., Lahontan r., Cannon r.,
Nicollet, text and map. It is commonly supposed that the stream marked R.
aux Raisins on Franquelin's map of 1688 is this river, and I see no objection to
this identification; for though the name is suspiciously like a mistake for R.
aux Racines, the river is laid down as above the Chippewa, and can hardly have
been intended for Root r. The main question is whether R. Morte and R.
Longue (Long r.), Lahontan, 1686-87, are names to be added to the synonyms
of this stream. The Baron Lahontan, "Lord Lieutenant of the French colony
at Placentia in Newfoundland," gives an account of himself on the Miss. r. in
Letter XVI. of his book, pp. 104-141 of the English ed., Lond., 1735. This
letter is "Dated at Missilimakinac, May 28th, 1689, containing an Account of
the Author's Departure from, and Return to Missilimackinac. A Description
of the Bay of Puante, and its Villages. An Ample Description of the Beavers;
followed by the journal of a remarkable Voyage upon the Long
River, and a Map of the adjacent Country." According to this relation
Lahontan came by the Fox-Wisconsin route to Prairie du Chien Oct. 23d,
1686, thus hard upon the heels of Accault's party, who had Hennepin along:
"On the 3d [of Nov.] we entered the Mouth of the Long River, which looks
like a lake full of Bull-rushes; we found in the middle of it a narrow Channel,"
etc. He continued his journey, on paper if not on the river, and returned
to the Mississippi Mar. 2d, 1687; dropped down to the Missouri Mar. 17th;
went up the Missouri to the Osage r.; down the Missouri to the Mississippi
again Mar. 25th; down the Mississippi to the Wabash, and back up to the Illinois
Apr. 7th; up the Illinois to Fort CrÃªvec&oelig;ur Apr. 16th; arrived at
"Chekakou" Apr. 24th; and made Michilimackinac soon afterward. The
whole <i>crux</i> of Lahontan's relation is in his Long r., which he professes to
have ascended a great distance to the countries of the Eororos, Esanapes, and
Gnacsitares, where he also got wind of equally peculiar people called Mozeemlek
and Tahuglauk. The main feature of his map is the "Morte or River Longue,"
represented as larger than that portion of the Mississippi which he traces, and
as heading in a great lake which connects across high mountains by numerous
large streams with another great river which runs off his map due W.
<i>De te fabula narratur.</i> But there is nothing to forbid us to suppose that
Lahontan went up to or toward, or even ascended, some such stream as Cannon
r., and then simply tacked this on to St. Peter's r. by hearsay. We must
in justice observe that all he professes to know about Long r. above the point
he says he ascended it he acknowledges he got from the natives; and he is
careful to separate his map into two parts by a heavy line lettered "The
Division of the Two Maps," <i>i. e.</i>, his own and one "drawn upon Stag-skins
by y<sup>e</sup> Gnacsitares." Such a piece of patch-work would easily make his
Long r. out of Cannon or some similar stream, run on to the whole course
of St. Peter's above the Mankato or Blue Earth r. Fortunately we have
little to do with the Baron's crazy-quilt, but I must here quote Nicollet,
because he sees reason to believe that Lahontan really did ascend Cannon
r., and has signalized his conclusion by naming it Lahontan r. on his map.
Though the gentle Nicollet's quality of mercy was never strained, yet his
judgments, even his special pleadings, deserve always the most respectful consideration.
Nicollet says, in substance, Rep. pp. 20, 21, that he was forced
to this conclusion after surveying the Undine region; that the principal statements
of the Baron "coincided remarkably well with what I have laid down
as belonging to Cannon river.... His account, too, of the mouth of the river
is particularly accurate"; the objection that the Baron says that he navigated
Long r. in November and December, when it is usually frozen, is in part
overcome by the fact that it is one of the last to freeze, and the last resort of
the wild fowl; and while he must convict the Baron of "gross exaggeration of
the length of the river," of its numerous population, and other pretended
information, he would conclude "that if La Hontan's claims to discoveries
are mere fables, he has had the good fortune or the sagacity to come near the
truth." As this musty old straw has never been threshed over to find any
more grains of wheat in it than Nicollet believed he had garnered, no one else
is likely in the future to make more of it than this; and our alternative seems
to be to accept Nicollet's results, or <i>noll. pros.</i> the whole case. I incline to the
former, partly from my habitual inclination to account for as many historical
names as possible, partly because I have so much confidence in Nicollet. It
does not seem to have occurred to him that his view of the case would be
strengthened by the original though probably not new suggestion I have made,
to the effect that fables of the St. Peter, tacked on to some facts of Cannon
r., would explain Lahontan's Long r.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-67" id="Footnote_I-67" href="#FNanchor_I-67"><span class="label">[I-67]</span></a> The present town of Redwing or Red Wing, Goodhue Co., Minn., commemorates
this chieftain, and preserves the site of his village with entire
exactitude. Pike's <a href="#Page_346">tabular statement</a>, bound in this work, calls him Talangamane,
L'Aile Rouge, and Red Wing; his tribe, Minowa Kantong, Gens du Lac,
and People of the Lakes. Beltrami, II. p. 186, makes one Tantangamani
"the unnatural father of the unhappy OholoaÃ¯tha." "Major Long arrived on
the evening of the 30th [of June, 1823] at an Indian village, which is under
the direction of Shakea, (the man that paints himself red;) the village has
retained the appellation of Redwing, (aile rouge,) by which this chief was
formerly distinguished," Keating's Long, I. p. 251, where the name which
Pike renders "Talangamane" is given as that of Red Wing's son, Tatunkamene,
and translated Walking Buffalo. "The Redwing chief is, at present
[1823], very much superannuated, but he is still much respected on account
of his former distinguished achievements," <i>ibid.</i>, p. 260. More about him to
come in Pike, beyond.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-68" id="Footnote_I-68" href="#FNanchor_I-68"><span class="label">[I-68]</span></a> Frontenac to Red Wing, some 13 miles by present channel, whence it is a
couple of miles further to the head of the island opp. Cannon r. camp. Pike
coasts the Minnesota shore till he finishes with the lake at the mouth of Bullard's
or Ida cr., a streamlet that makes in at a town called after the chief
Wakouta, Wacouta, Wakuta, etc. Here he enters one of the channels by
which the Mississippi finds its way into the lake, no doubt the middle one,
then as now the main one, which, however, soon joins the south one; the
north channel is narrower, crookeder, shoaler, and connected with some expansions
known as Upper and Lower lakes and Goose bay. The town of Red
Wing is situated on the S. side of a sharp bend the river makes in coming from
the Cannon, on a plain under bluffs that nearly encompass the town; one
of these is specially notable as the isolated elevation forming a conspicuous
landmark on the very brink of the river. This is Barn bluff, or Barn mountain,
so named by tr. of F. La Grange; it is Â¾ of a mile long and 345 feet
above low water mark; "upon the highest point of the Grange. Major Long,
who ascended it in 1817, observed an artificial mound, whose elevation above
its base was about five feet," Keating, I. p. 296. Nicollet made the altitude
322 feet, with commendable caution; Owen gave 350 feet, almost correctly.
This word <i>Grange</i> is often found as Gange: thus Beltrami has in text, p. 189,
mountain of the Gange, and Gange r.; latter also on map, and I suppose
Ganges r. could be found, even at this distance from India. About the
mouth of Cannon r., opp. Pike's camp, there was a place called Remnichah;
both Nicollet and Owen chart Remnicha r. or cr. as a stream falling in close to
the mouth. While Remnicha or Hhemnicha was a name of Red Wing's village,
it also covered the whole tract from Barn bluff to Cannon r. Mr. A. J. Hill informs
me of "a small ravine or coulÃ©e which ran through Red Wing's village,
and in 1854, when I lived there, was called the Jordan. It only headed a few blocks
back, and is now doubtless a sewer or filled up." So Nicollet's Remnicha r. is
that now known as Hay cr., above which a certain Spring cr. makes in on the same
side. Present town of Trenton, Pierce Co., Wis., is about a mile above camp.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-69" id="Footnote_I-69" href="#FNanchor_I-69"><span class="label">[I-69]</span></a> Discovery of the St. Croix r. is commonly attributed to Accault's party,
already mentioned as consisting of himself, Auguelle, and Hennepin, prisoners
in the hands of the Sioux at the time. The date is 1680; day in question.
According to La Salle's letter of Aug. 22d, 1682, written at Fort Frontenac,
in Margry's Relations, II. p. 245 <i>seq.</i>, it was very shortly after the 22d of April,
1680, when the Indians who were carrying them off had come up the Mississippi
to 8 leagues below the falls of St. Anthony, and then determined to finish their
journey by land to their village at Mille Lacs. As the St. Croix is more than
24 m. below Minneapolis, this party must have passed its mouth about the
date said. The Memoir of Le Sieur Daniel Greysolon Du Luth to the Marquis
of Seignelay, 1685 (Archives of the Ministry of the Marine), states that in June,
1680, he entered a river 8 leagues from the end of Lake Superior, ascended it,
made a half league portage, and fell into "a very fine river," which took him to
the Mississippi r. This was the St. Croix, which Du Luth thus certainly
descended to its mouth at that time. He heard of the captivity of his countrymen
with indignation and surprise, hired a Sioux to show him where they were,
and rescued them; he says that he put them in his canoes and carried them to
Michelimakinak, whence, after wintering there, they set out for the settlements
Mar. 29th, 1681. It is quite possible that before the great triangular duel
which La Salle, Du Luth, and Hennepin managed to arrange among themselves
over the operations of 1680, the St. Croix was seen by the missionary
Menard, who in 1661 may have reached the Mississippi by way of the St. Croix
or some other way, and was soon after lost. Marquette is not in question here, as
he came by the Wisconsin to the Mississippi and went down the latter. So with
any other person who reached the Mississippi prior to 1680. Excepting the
Menard matter, which is uncertain, the case narrows to Accault's party and
Du Luth, within some weeks of each other, late spring and early summer of
1680; the facts appear to be that the former first passed the mouth of the St.
Croix, and the latter first descended this river. Hennepin first named the river
R. de Tombeau, Descr. Louis., 1683, map; this is translated Tomb r., as,
<i>e. g.</i>, Shea's Hennepin, 1880, p. 199, where we read: "Forty leagues above
[Chippewa r.] is a river full of rapids, by which, striking northwest [read N. E.],
you can proceed to Lake CondÃ© [L. Superior], as far as Nimissakouat [in
Margry Nemitsakouat, in the Nouv. DÃ©c. Nissipikouet, being the Bois BrÃ»lÃ©]
river, which empties into that lake. This first river is called Tomb river because
the Issati [Sioux] left there the body of one of their warriors, killed by a rattlesnake,
on whom, according to their custom, I put a blanket." Some translate
Grave r. On Franquelin's map, 1688, the St. Croix is lettered R. de la Magdelaine,
though a certain Fort St. Croix appears about its head; by whom it was
first called Magdalene r. I am not informed. Lahontan's map shows nothing
here; he was too full of his fabulous Long r. to concern himself much with real
rivers. Next come Lesueur and his people, 1695; he had first reached the
Mississippi in 1683, and on this his second appearance (his third being in 1700)
they built the trading-house called Fort Lesueur on PelÃ©e isl., just below the
mouth of the St. Croix, as already noted. His editor, so far as this trip is concerned,
is the clever carpenter Penicaut, a sensible, fair-and-square man. Just
here comes in the question of the first application of the <i>name</i> St. Croix. The
river was already so called and the name in use before 1700; thus, Nicolas
Perrot's prise de possession, a document dated at Fort St. Antoine, May 8, 1689,
mentions the RiviÃ¨re-Sainte-Croix. The Carte du Canada ou de la Nouvelle
France, par Guillame de L'Isle, Paris, 1703, traces the river and letters it "L.
&amp; R. Ste. Croix," <i>i. e.</i>, as some have translated it, Lake and River Holy Cross;
said lake being, of course, the dilation of the same bottle-nosed river, which issues
from a contracted orifice, but is a mile or two wide higher up. But whatever
the theological proclivity to suppose this name to have been given for the usual
instrument of the execution of Roman malefactors, later put by the Emperor
Constantine on his banner, and afterward used for other purposes, it is certain
that the Christian crucifix is not directly implied in the name. It is a personal
designation, connoting one Sainte Croix or Saint Croix, a trader named in La
Harpe's MSS. of Lesueur's third voyage as a Frenchman who had been wrecked
there; for we read: "September 16 he [Lesueur] passed on the east a large
river called Sainte-Croix, because a Frenchman of that name was shipwrecked
at its mouth." Hennepin names Sainte Croix as one of six men who deserted La
Salle. A letter written in June, 1684, by Du Luth to Governor De la Barre (who
succeeded Frontenac in 1682), states that the writer had met one Sieur de la Croix
and his two companions. This case resembles those of La Crosse r. already
noted, and St. Pierre r., noted beyond. It may be summed in the statement
that St. Croix r., St. Pierre r., and Lake Pepin, were all three so named for
persons, by Lesueur or his companions, not earlier than 1683 and not later
than 1695; best assignable date, 1689. The river has also been called Hohang
or Fish r. (<i>cf.</i> Sioux Hogan-wanke-kin). The character of St. Croix's r. as a
waterway to the Great Lakes is elsewhere discussed. This stream now forms
the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota from its mouth to beyond 46Â° N.,
where it splits up into small streams in Burnett Co., Wis. Its general course is
not far from S.&mdash;it is due S. for many miles before it falls into the Mississippi;
which latter, for a great distance above their confluence, has a general bearing
S. E. Immediately at the mouth of the St. Croix, on the E., is Prescott, Pierce
Co., Wis., the site of which was once recommended by Long for a military post;
on the W. is Point Douglas, Washington Co., Minn.; and across the Mississippi,
a very little higher up, is Hastings, seat of Dakota Co., Minn., at the mouth of
Vermilion r. The above-mentioned dilation of the river into Lake St. Croix
extends some 30 m. up from its mouth; and as far above this lake as an Indian
ordinarily paddled his canoe in a day was the long-noted Sioux-Chippewa boundary,
at a place which became known as Standing Cedars. Thus the river did
duty in Indian politics before it set bounds to our Minnesota and Wisconsin.
This lake was often called Lower St. Croix l., in distinction from the sizable
body of water at the head of the river known as Upper St. Croix l. For the
route thence by Burnt r. to Lake Superior, see <a href="#Footnote_VII-12">a note beyond</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-70" id="Footnote_I-70" href="#FNanchor_I-70"><span class="label">[I-70]</span></a> Especially as it leaves us in the lurch for mileage of the 19th. But we
can easily overhaul him before he gets to St. Paul, which is only 30 river-miles
from Prescott (mouth of St. Croix r.). He did not go far above this
river; for he makes it 26Â½ + 8 = 34Â½ m. to the Sioux village, which latter was
close to the present city limits of St. Paul. If we must set a camp for him, it
may be assigned to Hastings, Dakota Co., Minn., 2Â½ m. above Prescott, Pierce
Co., Wis., and 18Â½ m. below Newport, Washington Co., Minn., in the vicinity
of which he will camp to-morrow. "Tattoo," at which the blunderbuss was
fired, is not a place, as the context and capitalization might suggest, but a certain
military call which is habitually sounded in garrisons and camps in the
evening before taps. It marks the hour when the soldiers are supposed to
retire to their quarters for their devotions before the lights are put out at taps,
and when the officers settle down in earnest for the night's poker. In approaching
the St. Croix from his camp opposite Cannon r., Pike has bluffs off his
right nearly all the way, and the town of Diamond Bluff, Pierce Co., Wis., is
at the point where they first reach to the river, a mile and a half above the
mouth of Trimbelle r., right, and 11 m. below Prescott. On the left the bluffs
are off the river all the way, and for most of this distance Vermilion slough,
running under the bluffs, cuts off an island 11 m. long and at its widest near
3 m. broad. The lower outlet of the slough is below Trimbelle r.; the middle
opening is only 3 m. below Prescott; the upper one is at Hastings. The bottom-land
of the principal island has several bodies of water, one of them called
Sturgeon l., discharging separately from the main slough; and is traversed
lengthwise by a sand-bank 6 m. long, which may be called Lesueur's Terrace.
For this Prairie or Bald isl. is no doubt that formerly known as Isle PelÃ©e, on
which was built Fort Lesueur, 1695. The middle opening of Vermilion slough
is in common with a lower outlet of Vermilion r. This is Rapid r. of Long, and
RiviÃ¨re Jaune of the French; "R. Jaune" appears on Franquelin's map, 1688.
The upper discharge of this river is at Hastings, and thus above the mouth of
the St. Croix; Lake Isabel is a small sheet between the river and the town.
The Minnesota county line between Goodhue and Dakota strikes the Mississippi
just 1Â¼ m. below the lower mouth of Vermilion r. At the mouth of the
St. Croix the Mississippi ceases or rather begins to separate Wisconsin from
Minnesota; so that henceforth Pike proceeds in the latter State.</p>

stone.... It is a fragment of syenite, which is about four and a half feet in
diameter.... The Indians frequently offer presents to the Great Spirit near
this stone," etc. The party found near the stone an eagle's feather, roots of
<i>Psoralea esculenta</i>, and willow sticks painted red; they secured a fragment of
the idol for their mineralogical collection. At the time of this visit (1823) there
was an Indian burying-ground a short distance above&mdash;in sight from the spot&mdash;if
that place can be called a burying-ground where the bodies are not buried
in the ground but scaffolded in the air; a mode of disposition of the dead which
might be called hypsitaphy, in distinction from bathytaphy or ordinary underground
interment. See <a href="#Page_79">Pike's remarks</a> on Sioux burial on the 21st. To reach
the sacred spot, hallowed by association with the deepest religious emotions of
the untutored aboriginal mind, Pike left Hastings, where the river was bridged
by the C., M. and St. P. R. R. in 1871 (Act of Minn. Legisl., Feb. 7th, 1867), and
soon passed the site of Nininger, Dakota Co., a small town built at the lower
point of a steep bluff which fronts the river's edge on the S., at the mouth of the
rivulet which serves as the upper discharge of Lake Rebecca or King l.&mdash;in fact
the whole bottom on his left is an island 2Â¾ m. long, extending from Hastings
to Nininger, being cut off by the slough of which King l. is a dilation. On
the right, in Washington Co., bluffs front the river for a mile or more, to
the lower opening of Boulanger slough, which cuts off an island 2Â½ m. long.
The immediate frontage of the Nininger bluffs on the river is less than a mile,
for they recede at the lower opening of Nininger slough. The river thus winds
from side to side of its bed, with alternation of bluffs and bottom on each side.
Above Nininger slough the river makes a great loop to the left; the whole
irregular curve is subtended on the right by Grey Cloud slough, about 4 m. long
direct, and longer by its meanders, thus cutting off Grey Cloud isl., of the same
length, and over 2 m. wide in some places; town site Grey Cloud, Washington
Co., on the river bank on this island, which also presents at its northern end
a limestone rock, 50 to 75 feet above low-water mark, and a mile or more long;
this is probably the Medicine Wood of Forsyth, 1819. Near the middle of the
loop, on the other side, is the <i>nominis umbra</i> site of Pine Bend, Dakota Co.,
where the river runs under the hills. This loop was formerly called DÃ©tour de
Pin or des Pins, whence its modern names Pine bend and Pine turn. The hills
border the river pretty closely for 5 m. further, to Merrimac, opposite which is
an island of the same name; within 1Â½ m. of this on the right hand, opposite
an island of its own name, is Newport, Washington Co.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-72" id="Footnote_I-72" href="#FNanchor_I-72"><span class="label">[I-72]</span></a> Newport to St. Paul&mdash;to a steamboat ldg. about the foot of Wabasha or
Robert st.&mdash;is 8Â½ m. by the channel, and considerably more than halfway up
to Pike's camp on the island at the mouth of St. Peter's or the Minnesota r.
Thus, though Pike calls to-day's voyage "24 miles," it is nearer 14. One who
then swept around the bold bend of the river at St. Paul saw a germ of that
great metropolis in the humble Sioux village, though only prescience could have
divined what time would make of the site above it. A later account than Pike's
is given in Keating's Long's Exp. of 1823, pub. 1824, I. p. 289: "Passed an
Indian village consisting of ten or twelve huts, situated at a handsome turn on
the river, about 10 miles below the mouth of the St. Peter; the village is generally
known by the name of the Petit Corbeau, or Little Raven, which was the
appellation of the father and grandfather of the present chief. He is called
Chetanwakoamene (the good sparrow-hunter). The Indians designate this band
by the name of Kapoja, which implies that they are deemed lighter and more
active than the rest of the nation." This was a band of Mdewakantonwan
Sioux (the Minowa Kantong of Pike), for which, as well as for the celebrated
chief himself, see notes beyond. The term which Keating renders Kapoja is
now Kaposia, as a designation of the locality of South Park, a place on the west
bank of the river; but the old Sioux village was on the east bank, below Frenchman's
bar, in the low ground formerly called by the French Grand Marais, rendered
by Beltrami Great March (for Great Marsh, II. p. 197), and now rejoicing
in the epithet of Pig's Eye marsh or lake. Pig's Eye was the soubriquet of one
Peter Parrant, a whisky-seller who squatted on the bottom in 1838, below
Carver's Cave in the Dayton bluff. The whole region about the mouth of St.
Peter's r. had been a Sioux focus and stamping-ground for generations before
any of the localities thereabouts received names from us. The curious origin of
the name St. Paul for the present capital was in this wise: The limits of the
military reservation about Fort Snelling were authoritatively fixed in 1839.
The whisky-traders, loafers, and squatters about the place became so troublesome
that the U.Â S. Marshal of Wisconsin was directed to remove all such
intruders, who were given till next spring to decamp; and on May 6th, 1840,
the troops were called out to complete the eviction by the destruction of cabins.
In the words of E. D. Neill, Minn. Hist. Soc., II. Part 2, 1864, 2d ed. 1881,
p. 142: "The squatters then retreated to the nearest point below the military
reserve, and there they became the inglorious founders of a hamlet, which was
shortly graced with the small Roman Catholic chapel of St. Paul, the name of
which is retained by the thrifty capital of Minnesota, which has emerged from
the groggeries of 'certain lewd fellows of the baser sort.'" The chapel above
mentioned was built by Rev. Lucian Galtier, on what is now Catholic block; it
fronted on Bench street. It was dedicated Nov. 1st, 1841. The first marriage
bans were those of one Vital Guerin, described as "a resident of St. Paul;"
and thus the priest named the place as well as the house, although it was also
called for a time St. Paul Landing, because some stores had been put up close
by, which caused steamboats to stop there. In 1848, when Minnesota acquired
Territorial organization, and the capital was fixed at St. Paul, no such place
could be found on ordinary maps; it was some obscure settlement, supposed to
be somewhere about the mouth of St. Peter's r., or in the vicinity of St.
Anthony's falls, perhaps at a place known as White Rock, or Iminijaska, where
some bluffs were more easily discernible than any village. Even down to 40
years ago, or a little before 1858, when Minnesota acquired statehood, St. Paul
had only replaced tepees with a sprinkling of log cabins; and people scrambled
up the bluff by digging their toes into the ground. The site of the city is
one which would hardly have been anticipated as such; nor would the original
features of the locality be easily recognized now after all the grading and terracing
that has been done to convert the stubborn hills and intractable hollows into
a beautiful city of over 190,000 inhabitants. But all this was to be, and is well
worth all that it cost. Among the natural features which should be noted
in this connection, especially as they have given rise to conflicting historical
statements, are Carver's Great Cave in Dayton's bluff, and Nicollet's New
(Fountain) Cave, halfway thence to Fort Snelling; but for these, as well as for
a third cave close to Carver's, see a <a href="#Footnote_III-30">note beyond</a>, at date of Apr. 12th, 1806,
when Pike's text brings the matter up.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-73" id="Footnote_I-73" href="#FNanchor_I-73"><span class="label">[I-73]</span></a> Jean Baptiste Faribault, b. Berthier, Lower Canada, 1774, d. Faribault,
Minn., Aug. 20th, 1860, being at the time the oldest white resident of the present
State. Jean Baptiste was the youngest one of 10 children of Bartholomew
(who was b. in Paris and came to Canada in 1754); he was in business in
Quebec 1790-97, at the latter date entered the employ of J. J. Astor as an agent
of the N. W. Co., and was engaged in the Indian trade at various points in the
Mississippi region for about 50 years, for the most part on his own account.
One of the posts he established was at the mouth of the Minnesota r., where
Pike found him. In 1814 he married a half-breed daughter of Major Hause
(then Superintendent of Indian Affairs), by whom he had eight children. His
Indian name was Chahpahsintay, meaning Beaver Tail. His eldest son, Alexander,
founded the present town of Faribault, Minn. Mr. J. B. Faribault
"espoused the cause of the U.Â S. during the war of 1812, and lost many thousand
dollars thereby, as well as narrowly escaping with his life on several occasions.
He labored all his life to benefit the red man, teach him agriculture and
the arts of industry, and protect his interests. He had an unbounded influence
over them; his advice was never disregarded. He was prominent at all treaties,
and rendered the U.Â S. many valuable services," says J. F. Williams, Minn.

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_I-74" id="Footnote_I-74" href="#FNanchor_I-74"><span class="label">[I-74]</span></a> The history of the discovery of St. Peter's r., off the mouth of which Pike
is now camped, is involved in some obscurity, which modern research has not
wholly cleared up, though the main facts have probably been certified. (1) It
has been conceded since Carver's time that Hennepin missed the river. Discovery
has not been traced back of Lesueur's time. Lesueur was first on the
Mississippi hereabouts in 1683; next in 1695, when he built on PelÃ©e isl., just
below the St. Croix; and again in 1700; both these rivers are noted in the
treatise of Nicolas Perrot, and before 1700 the river of St. Pierre had been so
named. (2) Charlevoix's account, Hist. N. Fr., Paris, 1744, IV. pp. 165, 166, is
in substance: In 1700 Lesueur, sent by D'Iberville to establish himself in the
Sioux country and take possession of a copper-mine <i>que le Sueur y avait dÃ©couverte</i>,
had already discovered there, some time before; ascended St. Peter 40
leagues to RiviÃ¨re Verte (now Blue Earth r.) which comes in on the left hand as
you go up; ascended this Green r. 1 league; built a fort and wintered there,
1700-1; in April, "1702," for which read 1701, went up Green r. Â¾ league to
his mine and in 22 days got out over 30,000 lbs. of ore, of which 4,000 selected
lbs. were sent to France; there was a mountain of this mineral 10 leagues long,
etc. (3) The Amer. Philos. Society's copy of the MS. of BÃ©nard de la Harpe is
carefully digested by Keating in Long's Exp., I. pp. 317-322. This MS. is entitled:
"Journal historique concernant l'Ã©tablissement des FranÃ§ais Ã  la Louisianne,
tirÃ© des mÃ©moires de Messrs. d'Iberville et de Bienville, etc., par M. BÃ©nard
de la Harpe." The original of this copy was in the hands of Dr. Sibley,
who certifies to the correctness of the copy in a note annexed, dated Natchitoches,
Oct. 29th, 1805. Some of the contents of this MS. are: (<i>a</i>) Lesueur and
d'Iberville, with 30 hands, reached the mouth of the Mississippi Dec., 1699.
Lesueur was sent there by M. l'Huillier, fermier gÃ©nÃ©ral, under orders to establish
himself at a place near the sources of the Mississippi, where he had <i>previously</i>
discovered a green ore, <i>i. e.</i>, in 1695. The substance of the 1695 discovery is:
Lesueur built a fort on an island (Isle PelÃ©e, now Prairie isl.) in the Mississippi
over 200 m. above the Illinois, by order of Count Frontenac; and the same year
he went to Montreal with the Chippewa chief ChingouabÃ© and the Sioux chief
TioscatÃ©, the latter the first of his nation that ever was in Canada, and received
very kindly by the authorities in view of what they hoped to make out of his
country. With this Sioux chief Lesueur had intended to reascend the Mississippi
in 1696; but the former died at Montreal after 33 days' illness. Lesueur,
thus released from an obligation to go back with the chief to the country where
he had discovered the ore, determined to go to France to ask leave to open
mines; this voyage he made, and had his permit in 1697. June, 1697, he embarked
at La Rochelle for Canada; was captured by the British on the Newfoundland
banks and carried to Portsmouth; after peace, returned to Paris for
a new commission, which was issued to him in 1698; went to Canada with this;
various obstacles threw him back to Europe; and meanwhile part of the men
whom he had left in charge in 1695 abandoned their posts and proceeded to
Montreal. Thus operations on the mines were suspended from 1695 to 1700,
for Lesueur and d'Iberville, with their 30 workmen, as we have seen, only
reached the mouth of the Mississippi in Dec., 1699. (<i>b</i>) The MS. we are following
states, under date of Feb. 10th, 1702, that Lesueur was that day come to
the mouth of the Mississippi with 2000 quintaux of blue and green earth. This
he certainly had got on his tour of Dec., 1699-Feb., 1702, from and back to the
mouth of the Mississippi, and he had got it from the mine he opened and
worked on RiviÃ¨re Verte or Blue Earth r., the principal branch of St. Peter's.
The MS. contains a narrative of this tour from July 12th to Dec. 13th, 1700.
It appears that Lesueur moved as follows: July 13th, mouth of the Missouri;
Sept. 1st, mouth of the Wisconsin; Sept. 14th, mouth of the Chippewa (on one
of whose branches he had found a 60-lb. mass of copper during his previous
journey); same day, Lake Pepin, so designated in the MS.; 16th, passed La
Croix r., so called from a Frenchman wrecked there; 19th, entered St. Peter's
r.; Oct. 1st had ascended this for 44Â¼ leagues, and then entered Blue r., so
called for the color of the earth on its banks; started an establishment at or
more probably near the mouth of Blue r., at what the MS. gives as lat. 44Â° 13Â´
N.; Oct. 14th, finished the works, which were named Fort L'Huillier; Oct.
26th, went to the mine with three canoes, which he loaded with colored earth
taken from mountains near which were mines of copper, samples of which
L'Huillier had assayed at Paris in 1696. Lesueur wintered there, 1700-1, and,
as we have seen, was back to the mouth of the Mississippi Feb. 10th, 1702.
(<i>c</i>) From these historical data Keating in Long, 1823, I. p. 320, infers that St.
Peter's and the Blue (Blue Earth) rivers were those streams which Lesueur had
ascended in 1695, which date is consequently assigned to the discovery, without
reference back to 1683. This inference is made "from the circumstance that
they are mentioned as well known, and not as recently discovered; and more
especially from the observation of la Harpe, that the eastern Sioux having complained
of the situation of the fort [L'Huillier], which they would have wished to
see at the confluence of the St. Peter and Mississippi, M. le Sueur endeavoured
to reconcile them to it. 'He had foreseen,' says la Harpe, 'that an establishment
on the Blue river would not be agreeable to the eastern Sioux, who are
the rulers of all the other Sioux, because they were the first with whom the
French traded, and whom they provided with guns; nevertheless, as this
undertaking had not been commenced with the sole view of trading for
beavers, but in order to become thoroughly acquainted with the quality of
the various mines <i>which he had previously discovered there</i> [italics Keating's],
he replied to the natives that he was sorry he had not been made sooner
acquainted with their wishes, &amp;c., but that the advanced state of the season
prevented his returning to the mouth of the river.' No mention is made
in this narrative of the stream being obstructed with ice, a circumstance which,
had it really occurred, would, we think, have been recorded by de la Harpe, who
appears to have been a careful and a curious observer, and who undoubtedly
saw le Sueur's original narrative." (4) On the foregoing data Nicollet, Rep.
1843, p. 18, has some judicious remarks in fixing Lesueur's locality with precision:
"On the left bank of the Mankato [Green, Blue, or Blue Earth r.],
six miles from its mouth, in a rocky bluff composed of sandstone and limestone,
are found cavities in which the famed blue or green earth, used by the Sioux as
their principal pigment, is obtained. This material is nearly exhausted, and it is
not likely that this is the spot where a Mr. Lesueur (who is mentioned in the
Narrative of Major Long's Second Expedition, as also by Mr. Featherstonhaugh)
could, in his third voyage, during the year 1700, have collected his 4000 pounds
of copper earth sent by him to France. I have reason to believe that Lesueur's
location is on the river to which I have affixed his name, and which empties into
the Mankato three-quarters of a league above Fort L'Huillier, built by him and
where he spent a winter. This location corresponds precisely with that
given by Charlevoix, whilst it is totally inapplicable to the former. Here
the blue earth is abundant in the steep and elevated hills at the mouth
of this river, which hills form a broken country on the right side of the
Mankato. Mr. [J. C.] Fremont and myself have verified this fact: he, during
his visit to Lesueur river; and I, upon the locality designated by Mr. Featherstonhaugh,
where the Ndakotahs formerly assembled in great numbers
to collect it, but to which they now seldom resort, as it is comparatively
scarce&mdash;at least so I was informed by Sleepy-eye, the chief of the Sissitons,
who accompanied me during this excursion." (5) Featherstonhaugh's remarks,
Canoe Voyage, etc., I. p. 280 and p. 304, seem to me less judicious than likely
to make the judicious grieve; in fine, they are singularly obtuse to have come
from so British a man and so clever a story-teller. He heads a page in caps,
"<span class="smcap">The Copper-mine, a Fable</span>;" he has in text, "finding the copper-mine to
be a fable"; again: "that either M. le Sueur's green cupreous earth had not
corresponded to the expectations he had raised, or that the whole account of it
was to be classed with Baron Lahontan's" fables, etc. This sort of talk would
befog the whole subject, were it not obvious that it has no bearing whatever
upon the historico-geographical case we are discussing. The question is <i>where</i>
Lesueur went, and <i>when</i> he got there&mdash;not at all what he found there. It is
obtuse, I say, because unintentionally misleading, for F'gh to say that, when he
reached the bluff whence the pigment had been taken, "Le Sueur's story lost
all credit with me, for I instantly saw that it was nothing but a continuation of
the seam which divided the sandstone from the limestone ... containing
a silicate of iron of a blueish-green color." In the first place, F'gh was not at
exactly the right spot, which Nicollet has pointed out. Secondly, though Lesueur
should have been mistaken or mendacious about any copper-mine being
in that region&mdash;though he should not have collected 30,000 lbs. of ore in 22
days, or even a gunny-sack full of anything in a year&mdash;though the mountains
should shrink to bluffs, and the whole commercial features of the case turn into
the physiognomy of the wild-cat&mdash;that would not affect the historical and geographical
facts, viz.: Lesueur ascended the St. Peter's to the Mankato, and this
as far at least as its first branch, thus exploring both these rivers in 1700. Item,
he had been to if not also up the river of St. Pierre in 1695; and it had been
known since his first voyage in 1683. (6) As to the name RiviÃ¨re St. Pierre, or
de St. Pierre, which we have translated St. Peter, or St. Peter's r., the former
obscurity of its origin has, I think, been almost entirely cleared up. Keating's
Long, 1824, I. p. 322, has: "We have sought in vain for the origin of the
name; we can find no notice of it; it appears to us at present not unlikely that
the name may have been given by le Sueur in 1795 [slip for 1695], in honor of
M. de St. Pierre Repantigni, to whom La Hontan incidentally alludes (I. p. 136)
as being in Canada in 1789 [<i>i. e.</i>, 1689]. This person may have accompanied
le Sueur on his expedition." Keating does not cite in this connection the
remark of Carver, ed. 1796, p. 35: "Here [at Lake Pepin] I discovered the
ruins of a French factory, where it is said Captain St. Pierre resided, and carried
on a very great trade with the Naudowessies [Sioux], before the reduction
of Canada." This person was Jacques Le Gardeur St. Pierre, who in 1737
commanded the fort on Lake Pepin (Fort Beauharnois). One Fort St.
Pierre was built at Rainy l. late in 1731; J. Le G. St. Pierre was there in
1751: for extended notice of him, see Neill, Macalester Coll. Cont., No. 4,
1890, pp. 136-40. His father was Captain Paul St. Pierre, who was sent to
the French post (Maison FranÃ§oise) at La Pointe (Chaquamegon bay) in 1718.
Nicollet, Rep. 1843, p. 68, cites Carver, and states: "I have no hesitation in
assigning its [the name's] origin to a Canadian by the name of De St. Pierre,
who resided for a long time thereabouts." The name appears for the first time
in Perrot's report, of the date 1689, which is also the most probable date of
naming the St. Croix r. and Lake Pepin. The only question left is, whether
the river was not named to compliment <i>Pierre</i> Lesueur himself. Whoever the
St. Pierre whose name the river bears may prove to be, the name is a personal
one, which we should not have translated into English St. Peter; for it certainly
has nothing to do with the legendary saint so styled, whose career is connected
with the crowing of cocks three times more than with the course of any river.
Had the stream been named by some priest for such a sadly overworked patron
as the apocryphal first Bishop of Rome, we should have heard all about it in the
Jesuit Relations or elsewhere. (7) The suggestion that the name St. Pierre is a
perversion of <i>sans pierres</i> ("without stones"), may be dismissed as too good to
be true; for it is a settled principle of sound philology that the easiest etymologies
are the most likely to have been invented to fit the case, <i>ex post-facto</i>. (8) As
to native names, Nicollet says, <i>l. c.</i>: "The name which the Sioux give to the St.
Peter's river is <i>Mini-sotah</i>; and to St. Peter's, as a station [Mendota], <i>Mdote-mini-sotah</i>.
The adjective <i>sotah</i> is of different translation. The Canadians
translate it by a pretty equivalent French word, <i>brouillÃ©</i>&mdash;perhaps most properly
rendered into English by <i>blear</i>; as, for instance, <i>mini sotah</i>, blear water, or
the entrance of blear water. I have entered into this explanation, because the
word <i>sotah</i> really means neither clear nor turbid, as some authors have asserted;
its true meaning being readily found in the Sioux expression <i>ishta-sotah</i>, blear-eyed....
The Chippeways are more accurate; by them, the St. Peter's river
[is called] <i>Ashkibogi-sibi</i>, the Green Leaf river." It occurs to me that the distinction
Nicollet draws would correspond to <i>translucent</i>, as distinguished on the
one hand from colorless or transparent water, and on the other from opaque or
turbid water. I may also refer to the old medical term, <i>gutta serena</i>, for forming
cataract of the eye, when clear vision is obscured by a degree of opacity
that does not entirely exclude light. As applied to water, Sioux <i>sotah</i> may be
about equivalent to Greek <span class="greek" title="glaukos">Î³Î»Î±ÏÎºá½¹Ï</span>, Latin <i>glaucus</i>, variously rendered "gray,"
"bluish-green," etc., and Nicollet's "blear-eyed" be equivalent to what was
called <i>glaucoma</i> (<span class="greek" title="glaukÃ´ma">Î³Î»Î±á½»ÎºÏÎ¼Î±</span>). Notice what Pike says above of the color of the
water; but it must be added that, when he speaks of the Mississippi as
"remarkably red," we must understand only a reddish-yellow hue of its
shoal portions, imparted by its sands; and by "black as ink," only the darker
color of deeper places where the sands do not show through. The name Mini-sota
has a number of variants: for example, Carver, who wintered on it Nov.,
1766-Apr., 1767, has "the River St. Pierre, called by the natives the Waddapawmenesotor";
with which compare Watapan Menesota of Long, WatpÃ menisothÃ©
of Beltrami, and the title of Featherstonhaugh's diverting book,
"A Canoe Voyage up the Minnay Sotor," etc. It has become fixed of late
years, since an Act of Congress, approved June 19th, 1852 (Stat. at Large, X. p.
147), decreed that the noble river should bear the name of the State through
which it flows. (9) The Minnesota r. appears on various old maps of Louisiana
(not on Hennepin's, 1683). Franquelin's, 1688, traces it without any name, but
letters it with the name of the Indians, "Les Mascoutens Nadouescioux," <i>i. e.</i>,
Sioux of the Prairie, Gens du Large of the French, collectively, as distinguished
from Gens du Lac. De L'Isle's map, 1703, has "R. St. Pierre."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-1" id="Footnote_II-1" href="#FNanchor_II-1"><span class="label">[II-1]</span></a> The village which Pike visited is marked on his map on the west, upper, or
left bank of the Minnesota r., which here runs little E. of N. into the Mississippi.
The hill on the point whence the Sioux saluted him so savagely was the
scene of many a more warlike demonstration in after-years; for here was built
Fort St. Anthony, later known as Fort Snelling, one of the most important and
permanent military establishments in the United States, and for nearly half
a century the most notable place on the Mississippi above Prairie du Chien. It
was erected on the land which Pike secured by the transaction his text is about
to describe, and which extended thence up the river to include the falls of St.
Anthony, and thus the site of the present great city of Minneapolis, with St.
Paul the twin metropolis of the Northwest. The location of Fort Snelling is in
Nicollet's opinion "the finest site on the Mississippi river"; and I should be
the last to dissent from this judgment, after my enjoyable visit to the fort in
1873, at the invitation of General Alexander. The bluff headland is about 105
feet above the water; the two rivers separated by this rocky point are respectively
over 300 and nearly 600 feet broad. The height of Pilot Knob, across
the Minnesota r., is about 250 feet. The plateau on the point of which the fort
is situated stretches indefinitely S. W.; 8 m. direct N. W. are Minneapolis and the
falls. The Mississippi receives the Minnesota at the point of greatest convexity
of a deep bend to the S., duplicating that bend to the N. on which St. Paul is
situated, the two together forming quite a figure of <b>s</b>. Nothing came of Pike's
recommendation of this site for a military post till a report to the same effect
was made by Major Long, after his expedition of 1817, during which he reached
the place at 2 p. m., Wednesday, July 16th. On Feb. 10th, 1819, the Secretary
of War, John C. Calhoun, ordered the 5th infantry to proceed to the Mississippi
and establish regimental headquarters at the mouth of St. Peter's r. A
detachment of troops, mustering 98 rank and file, under Colonel Henry Leavenworth,
who had become lieutenant-colonel of that regiment Feb. 10th, 1818,
was first cantoned at New Hope, near Mendota, Sept. 24th, 1819, and preparations
were begun at once for a permanent structure. The winter of 1819-20
was disastrous from scurvy. On May 5th, 1820, camp was shifted to a place
near a spring, above the graveyard, and was thereupon named Camp Coldwater.
In the spring of 1820 Jean Baptiste Faribault located himself in the vicinity;
Governor Lewis Cass came from his exploration of the upper Mississippi during
the summer, and Lawrence Taliaferro's Indian agency was established as Camp
St. Peter's. As usual, the colonel commanding and the Indian agent clashed,
notably in the matters of medals and whisky. In August, 1820, Colonel Josiah
Snelling, who had become colonel of the regiment June 1st, 1819, arrived and
relieved Colonel Leavenworth of the command. He determined to build on
the point originally selected by Pike. The corner-stone of Fort St. Anthony is
supposed to have been laid Sept. 10th, 1820; and the building was so far forward
in the autumn of 1822 that the troops moved in, though it was not completed.
It is traditional that a tree on which Pike had cut his name was
ordered to be spared in the process of construction; but, if so, it soon disappeared.
On May 10th, 1823, the first steamboat, the Virginia, reached the
fort. It brought among other notables the Chevalier Beltrami. On July 3d,
1823, Major Long arrived, en route to his exploration of St. Peter's r. In 1824
General Winfield Scott visited the fort on a tour of inspection. It does not
appear to have struck anybody before that the name of a professional saint of
the Prince of Peace was absurdly inapplicable to any military establishment.
General Scott very sensibly reported that the name was "foreign to all our
associations," besides being "geographically incorrect," and recommended the
post to be named Fort Snelling, in well-deserved compliment to the distinguished
officer who had built it. The story of Fort Snelling, from its inception
to the end of all Indian collisions, is an integral and very prominent part of the
history of Minnesota; it is an honorable record, of which citizens and soldiery
may be equally proud&mdash;one replete with stirring scenes and thrilling episodes,
which in the lapse of years tradition has delighted to set in all the glamour of
romance. But the most sober historians have found a wealth of material in
the stern actualities of Fort Snelling. The facts in the case need no
embellishment. The following are some of the many references that could be
given to the early history of Fort Snelling: Occurrences in and around Fort
Snelling from 1819 to 1840, E. D. Neill, M. H. C., II. Part 2, 1864; 2d ed.

letter which Pike addressed to Wilkinson in this connection on the 23d, 24th,
and 25th, formed Docs. Nos. 4 and 5 of the App. to Part 1 of the orig. ed.

Here we may conveniently note the names of the chiefs concerned in the
transaction. The best article I have seen upon this subject is that by Dr.
Thomas Foster of Duluth, in the St. Paul Daily Democrat of May 4th, 1854,
as cited by J. Fletcher Williams in Minn. Hist. Coll., I. 2d ed. 1872, p. 379;
this, however, requires some additions and corrections.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. Little Crow and Little Raven are English equivalents of Petit Corbeau,
which latter is a French version of the name of the hereditary chiefs of the
Kapoja band, borne by successive individuals through several generations.
Pike's Little Crow is said by Long to have been son of Little Crow, who was
himself son of Little Crow; and Foster identifies Pike's Little Crow "as the
grandfather of the present chief, Little Crow," <i>i. e.</i>, of one of this name who
was chief in 1854, adding neatly that "he was the Great Crow of all," <i>i. e.</i>,
the most celebrated of all those who bore the name. This reference would
seem to cover five generations, from Pike's Little Crow backward to his grandfather
and forward to his grandson. Riggs renders Pike's Little Crow's name
Chatanwakoowamani, Who-walks-pursuing-a-hawk; says that his son's name
was Wamdetanka, or Big Eagle, who flourished in the thirties; and adds that the
dynasty became extinct with Taoyatidoota (or Towaiotadootah), who was the
Little Crow of the Sioux outbreak of 1862. He was a very black crow indeed,
this last of the <i>CorvidÃ¦</i>, and was killed by a Mr. Lamson in 1863. Confining
attention now to the one who seems by this reckoning to have been Little
Crow III. of the series I.-V., we find him tabulated by Pike as Chatewaconamini.
We have already found him cited by Long as Chetanwakoamene, rendered Good
Sparrow Hunter. Beltrami, II. p. 191, presents Chatewaconamani, or the
Little Raven, as the chief in 1823. Featherstonhaugh has a chief he calls
Tchaypehamonee, or Little Crow, living in 1835. Rev. Dr. Neill has in one
place Chatonwahtooamany, Petit Corbeau. Dr. Foster gives the Dakota name
as Tchahtanwahkoowahmane, or the Hawk that Chases Walking. Pike's Little
Crow lived many years after he "touched the quill" (signed his x mark) to the
cession, and was in Washington in 1824. Schoolcraft, who held a council with
the Wahpeton Sioux at Fort Snelling, July 25th, 1832, says, Narr., etc., 1834,
p. 146: "The aged chief Petite [<i>sic</i>] Corbeau uttered their reply. I recognized
in this chief one of the signers of the grant of land made at this place 26 years
ago, when the site of the fort was first visited by the late General Pike." The
death of this good man (in 1834?) occurred from a mortal wound he accidentally
inflicted upon himself in drawing his gun from a wagon, at his village of
Kaposia. The circumstances are narrated with interesting particulars by
General H. H. Sibley, Minn. Hist. Coll., III. 1874, pp. 251-54.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. The chief here and consistently throughout Pike's book of 1810 called Fils
de Pinchow appears in the 1807 text as Fils de Penichon, Penechon, or Pinechon;
but nowhere are we told of whom this eminent individual was the son.
The name seems to have been one to conjure with; and our curiosity is excited
to discover Pinchow I., who was such a personage that Pike's Fils de Pinchow,
or Pinchow II., needed no other title to glory. On looking up this subject,
I find, first, that "Pinchow," as rendered in the above text, and the three
forms given in the 1807 print, are four variants of a word which is
also written Pinichon, Pinchon, Penition, Pinneshaw, etc., in French or
English; and that these are corruptions of a Dakota word. Thus Beltrami,
II. p. 207, introduces us to one Tacokoquipesceni, or Panisciowa, as being in
1823 chief of the old village on the St. Peter's, three miles above its mouth.
The shorter name which Beltrami uses is obviously the same as Pinchow, etc.,
while the longer one he uses is the same as that Takopepeshene of which we
read in Keating's Long, I. p. 385: "Wapasha formerly lived in that [old]
village, but having removed from it with the greater part of his warriors, a few
preferred remaining there, and chose one of their number as a leader. His son
Takopepeshene, (dauntless,) now [1823] rules over them." We read further in
Keating's Long, I. p. 419, of the Nanpashene, or "Dauntless Society," as an
association of young braves who feared nothing: see further in this matter,
Lewis and Clark, ed. 1893, p. 96. So the connection of all these words is
obvious, though the genetic relationships of the individuals bearing the name is
not so clear. I suppose that Pike, Beltrami, and Long all refer to one and the
same individual, <i>i. e.</i>, to the son of that individual whom the warriors who preferred
to remain at the said village chose as their leader. Dr. Foster, as above
cited, says that Pinchon, or Pinichon, etc., was the grandfather of one Good Road,
and in his tribe the most noted chief of the eastern Sioux; the name conferred
upon this chief being Tahkookeepayshne, or "What is he afraid of?" implying
the affirmation that he was afraid of nothing. This having been corrupted by
the French to Pinchon, etc., and taken up in English as Pinneshaw, etc., was
readopted by the Sioux themselves as a common noun, rather than a proper
name, to designate a very brave man; so that they would speak of such or such
a one as a pinneshaw. Recurring now to the individual whom Pike names Fils
de Pinchow, we elsewhere find him listed by Pike under the name of Wyaganage,
as a chief of the Gens du Lac and head of the village Pike visited at the
mouth of the St. Peter's; this is the Way Ago Enagee whose name appears
above as that of a signer by his <b>x</b> mark of the grant of land; and such appears
to be the only name by which he became officially known to us. It is spelled
differently in every one of the several places where I have found it in print or
in manuscript; but in no case irrecognizably.</p>

<p class="footnote">3. We know no more of the Grand Partisan than this name or title. Dr.
Foster supposes him to have been only a principal soldier&mdash;certainly not a chief.</p>

<p class="footnote">4. "Le Original Leve" is decidedly original! The queer phrase stands for
L'Orignal LevÃ©, given in the text of 1807 as Le Orignal LevÃ©, and thus nearly
right. The individual thus designated is listed on Pike's <a href="#Page_346">tabular exhibit</a> as
Tahamie, Orignal leve, and Rising Moose; he is also mentioned in Pike's letter
to Wilkinson of Sept. 23d-26th, 1805, as Elan Levie. There is no doubt about
the meaning of these phrases; for <i>orignal</i>, <i>orignac</i>, <i>oriniac</i>, <i>orenac</i>, etc., are
Basque forms of a name of the moose, which animal, as well as the elk, is also
called <i>Ã©lan</i>, while <i>levÃ©</i> certainly implies that the animal had arisen, and was
standing on his legs, not that he was in the act of rising. Dr. Foster evidently
did not know what the French phrase should be, for he presents Pike's peculiar
cacographies, and is brought to book about it by Mr. Williams; but he gives
us some interesting particulars of the chief who bore these names, and I
transcribe his remarks in substance. Tah'amie, L'Orignal LevÃ©, or Standing
Moose is believed to be identical with an aged Indian whom most old Minnesotians
knew by the name of Tammahhaw, who had but one eye and always
wore a stove-pipe hat. He used to boast that he was the only "American"
Sioux&mdash;by which he meant that in the war of 1812, when the Sioux sided with
the British, and Little Crow and Joseph Reinville led a war-party against the
Americans, he refused to join them and went to St. Louis, where he entered the
service of the Americans in the employ of General William Clark. In 1854 he
still treasured a commission he had received in 1814 (or May 6th, 1816?) from
General Clark. Dr. Foster remarks that if there is no mistake in the identity,
the friendship Tahamie conceived for Pike stood the test of time, and the two
fought together against our common enemies&mdash;a fact which our government
should not overlook. One Joseph Mojou, an old Canadian of Point Prescott,
told Dr. Foster that Tamahaw was called by the voyageurs "Old Priest,"
because he was such a talker on all occasions; and Dr. Foster remarks that the
Sioux word <i>tamwamda</i>, which resembles this Indian's name, means to vociferate,
reiterate, harangue, etc. Mr. E. A. C. Hatch informed Dr. Foster that when
he traded with the Winnebagoes, and with Wabasha's band of Sioux, he knew
the Indian and had seen the commission issued by General Clark; also, that
the Winnebagoes, who were acquainted with this Indian, translated his name
Nazeekah in their language&mdash;this being their word for the pike, a fish, and
<i>tammahhay</i> being the Dakotan word for that fish. According to J. F. Williams,
Minn. Hist. Coll., III. 1874, p. 15, Tahama or Tahamie was called by the French
Le Bourgne (Borgne), and by the English One-eye, or the One-eyed Sioux, and
that the loss of the eye occurred by accident in a game during his boyhood. He
was born at Prairie Ã  l'Aile, the present site of Winona, and died in April, 1860,
"at least 85 years old, though some who knew him well place his age at nearly
100." A daguerreotype likeness of him, procured at Wabasha in 1859 by Hon.
C. S. Bryant, is in the possession of the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>

<p class="footnote">5. "Le Demi Douzen" is not named elsewhere in this book, and does not
appear at all in the 1807 edition. If the phrase which represents his name
means Half Dozen, or Six, it would be better written Demie Douzaine, or
Demi-douzaine; but we have seen enough of Pike's French to be already
satisfied that he always saluted the letters of the French alphabet with blank
cartridges. The Indian he calls Demi Douzen is thoroughly identified by Dr.
Foster as the father of the present (1854) chief Little Six, and the chief of the
large Sioux village which was situated 28 m. up the St. Peter's, 3 or 4 m. this
side of the modern Indian village of Shakopee. The father&mdash;the one who
attended Pike's conference&mdash;was known as Shahkpay, Half Dozen, and Six;
his son as Shahkpaydan, or Little Six, the former being the second of the name,
or Six II., and the latter the third of the name, or Six III.; but who was the
original Half Dozen, or Six I., founder of this dynasty, we are not informed.
Long speaks of Six II. as Shakpa, chief of the village Taoapa; and Forsyth
calls this one "Mr. Six, a good-for-nothing fellow."</p>

<p class="footnote">6. "Le Beccasse" of the above text was a stumbling-block. In the 1807
edition the term appears as Le Bucasse. It looks as if it were meant for La
BÃ©casse, meaning Woodcock. But Dr. Foster (whose text as cited by Mr.
Williams has Le Boccasse) informs us that the phrase should be written Bras
Casse&mdash;by which he evidently means Bras CassÃ©, as he translates Broken Arm.
(Pike's <a href="#Page_346">tabular exhibit</a> presents a certain Bras Casse; but this was a <i>Sauk</i>
chief, otherwise Pockquinike.) Broken Arm's Sioux name is believed by Dr.
Foster to have been Wahkantahpay; "and as late as 1825 he was still living
at his small village of Wahpaykootans, on a lake near the Minnesota [river]
some five or six miles below Prairie La Fleche, now Le Sueur."</p>

<p class="footnote">7. Le B&oelig;uf que [qui] Marche, or Walking Buffalo, as we are informed by
Dr. Foster, was also called Tahtawkahmahnee; "he was a kind of sub-chief
of old Wabashaw (who was not present), being also called Red Wing; and it
is from him that the village at the head of Lake Pepin derives its name. He
was the father [Hancock says uncle] of Wahkootay, the present [1854] old
chieftain of the Red Wing band." Compare <a href="#Footnote_I-67">note<sup>67</sup></a>, p. 69.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-3" id="Footnote_II-3" href="#FNanchor_II-3"><span class="label">[II-3]</span></a> Outard Blanche, correctly Outarde Blanche, means White Bustard. The
bustard is a very large bird, many species of which inhabit Europe, Asia, and
Africa, but none America. It may, therefore, be well to explain that outarde
was a name given by the early French in America to the Canada goose (<i>Bernicla
canadensis</i>); but that since this goose is mostly black, the phrase outarde blanche
would rather indicate the snow goose (<i>Chen hyperboreus</i>), which when adult
is pure white excepting the tips of the wings. I remember seeing somewhere
a statement, the source of which I cannot now recall, to the effect that the
phrase meant White Buzzard, not White Bustard; in which case the French
form would be Busard Blanc. Major Taliaferro speaks of White Buzzard in
his autobiography, as printed in Minn. Hist. Coll., VI. Part 2, 1891, p. 225,
p. 234, etc. Major Forsyth calls him White Bustard. However this may be, it
is certain that there was a chief of the name of Mahgossau, who was called Old
Bustard, and for many years known to the whites by the latter designation.
For an account of the stabbing of this chief in a whisky-bout, in the summer
of 1820, see letter of Lawrence Taliaferro, Indian agent at St. Peters, dated
Aug. 5th, 1820, in Minn. Hist. Coll., II. Part 2, 1864, 2d ed. 1881, p. 104.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-4" id="Footnote_II-4" href="#FNanchor_II-4"><span class="label">[II-4]</span></a> Setting camp close to a small stream which falls in on Pike's left, and which
has acquired great celebrity for its pretty little water-fall. For this is no other
than the Minnehaha. It is a wonder Pike missed Minnehaha falls; or that, if
he was informed of them, he did not take the trouble to go less than a mile up
the stream to see so pretty a spectacle. About 2Â½ m. from Fort Snelling, on
the road to Minneapolis, the stream spills over the bluff, with as clear a descent
as water ordinarily makes from the nozzle of a spout. The picturesque features
of this place may be imagined, or easily inspected by ordinary tourist travel;
the poetical and sentimental are well developed by Longfellow in Hiawatha;
the hydrographic are a creek 5 yards wide, falling 43 feet in an unbroken parabolic
curve. This was formerly plain Brown's cr. and Brown's fall; Nicollet
named the stream Cascade cr.; but it will doubtless always be best known by
the name which Longfellow transferred from its original to a new application,
to suit the exigencies of verse. This stream is the discharge of Lake Minnetonka.
In its course it receives the outlet of a chain of lakes from the W.,
called Bass (modern), Calhoun (Nicollet), and Harriet (Nicollet); nearer the
falls is a set of smaller lakes, whose modern names are Diamond, Pearl, Duck,
Mother, Amelia, and Rice (latter, the Lake Ann of times when Fort Snelling
was Fort St. Anthony, an expansion of Brown's cr. itself).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-5" id="Footnote_II-5" href="#FNanchor_II-5"><span class="label">[II-5]</span></a> The rapids Pike thus ascends to the falls, and the comparative characters of
the two gorges, of the Mississippi and Minnesota respectively, which unite at
Fort Snelling, indicate that in prehistoric time the falls were located about the
position of the fort. But there has been no natural recession within the brief
historic period&mdash;merely a momentary flash on the screen of geologic duration.
The most marked alteration of the falls that we know of was the accidental
result of an unintended interference by man. This happened from the bursting
of a log-boom. "Behind the boom were thousands of logs two or three feet
across and twelve feet long. These descending by the fall probably acquired a
velocity of not less than 64 feet a second, and striking endwise on the dÃ©bris of
the hard copping rock pulverized it so that the undermining of the soft sand rock
which this dÃ©bris protected went on with great rapidity," Warren, Ex. Doc.
No. 57, 1866-7, p. 19. On July 5th, 1880, the Minn. Hist. Soc. celebrated the
bi-centennial of the discovery of the falls, and there is no question that they were
first seen of white men by the two companions of Accault within a few hours of
July 5th, 1680, if not by the light of that very day. The occasion was a buffalo-hunt
down river from the great Sioux town on Lake Buade (Mille Lacs), when the
Indians brought the Picard and the priest (two of their three prisoners) along.
The falls were named by Hennepin Sault de S<sup>t</sup>. Antoine de PadoÃ¼ (so map, 1683)
"in gratitude for the favors done me by the Almighty through the intercession
of that great saint whom we had chosen patron and protector of all our enterprises,"
as Shea's tr. Hennep., 1880, p. 200, puts it. What these favors were is
not evident in the light of history; according to Hennepin's own relation, God's
gracious designs, whatever they may have been, were effectually disconcerted by
the Sioux, who took this slavish son of superstition by the nape of the neck and
otherwise subjected him to dire indignities; while as to the monk Anthony,
that Franciscan was born at Lisbon, Aug. 15th, 1195, died at Padua, June 13th,
1231, and there is not a scintilla of evidence that he did anything whatever subsequent
to this latter date. We might laugh off even so glaring an anachronism as
a mere theological pleasantry which deceives no one, were it not for the injustice
it does to La Salle, who furnished the sinews of war for Accault's, Auguelle's,
and Hennepin's campaign, and was the only person who patronized their trip,
saving the said Sioux, who turned it into a personally conducted tour like our
modern Cook's. "Saut St. Antoine" appears on Franquelin's map, 1688. The
Sioux called these falls Minirara, the laughing water, whence Minnehaha. In
Dakotan <i>ira</i> means to laugh, and the reduplicated form <i>irara</i> means to laugh
much or often; but <i>ira</i> is compounded of <i>i</i>, the mouth, and <i>ra</i>, to curl; and in
its application to the falls <i>rara</i>, which is simply <i>ra</i> reduplicated, should be
translated curling and not laughing waters. Ungeographical transfer of Minnehaha
to Brown's falls is simply poetical license. The Chip. name was Kakabikah,
alluding to the severed rock. Hennepin calls the falls "something very
astonishing," indeed "terrible," <i>more suo crasso</i>, and exaggerated the descent
of waters to 50 or 60 feet. Carver brings him to book about this, and reduces
the height to 30 feet. Pike's figures are very close indeed, and his description
is the most accurate we had in 1810; Long makes the height practically the
same, but Pike's breadth of 627 yards was reduced by Say and Calhoun in 1823
to 594. In view of these good measurements it is surprising that Schoolcraft
elevates the falls to 40 feet perpendicular, and narrows the width to 227 yards.
He was a man of great ability and still greater industry, whose acquirements
were extensive and varied; yet he must be taken warily, for there is many a
loose screw in his handiwork, and no structure is stronger than its weakest joint.
The trouble with Schoolcraft is two-fold; he tried to cover too much ground to
go over it thoroughly, and never emerged from the penumbra of that same theological
occultation which kept Hennepin's wits in total eclipse. The natural
beauty of this cataract was not destined to be a thing of joy forever; one's emotions,
on beholding it now, are those that might be aroused by any mill-tail of
similar dimensions. But the new beauty of utility has been conferred by human
skill and ingenuity in utilizing the vast water-power, to which Minneapolis
measurably owes her matchless progress and present opulence; pop. 1870,
13,000; 1880, 47,000; 1885, 129,000; now or lately, 220,000; thus surpassing
the 190,000 of her elder sister, St. Paul&mdash;in fact becoming the alter ego of
the wonderful pair. Considering the rapid building up of the fair interurban
district, and consequently the absorption of respective suburbs into mutualities,
it is logical to infer the complete Siamization of the splendid twins, and
a clutch at the laurels of Chicago or New York. By that time such scenes as
the Mississippi has here transferred to the canvas of human art will be shifted
to the Great Falls of the Missouri, where history will repeat itself in another
magnificent metropolis. Everything begins in watery elements; the force of
falling water controls the course of empire; and the conversion of gravitational
potentialities into electrical potencies realizes dreams of destiny, without the
intercession of saints or the interference of God.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-6" id="Footnote_II-6" href="#FNanchor_II-6"><span class="label">[II-6]</span></a> Decidedly less than this; it is only 18-20 m. by river or rail from Minneapolis
to Anoka, which Pike does not reach till to-morrow night; to-day's camp
between Casey's isls. and Coon cr., in Anoka Co. if on the right, in Hennepin
Co. if on the left. The three rapids he passed raised him from 792 to 808 feet
above sea-level; one of them is known as Fridley's bar, 5 m. above Minneapolis,
1Â½ m. below Durnam's isl. He had made the usual portage of the falls on the
right-hand side (left bank); and soon after decamping this morning he passed
on his left Bassett's cr., which runs through the city, or recently did so&mdash;what
disposition may have since been made of it I do not know. This was formerly
called Falls cr., as by Nicollet, who maps it in connection with his Lake
of the Isles and two other sheets. Either this or the next above on the same
side is also traced on Pike's map, without name. This next one is Shingle cr.,
called Omini Wakan cr. by Nicollet and by Owen; it comes in on the left a mile
or more below Fridley's bar. Half a mile above Durnam's isl., and on the
right, is Rice or Manomin cr., which Nicollet calls Ottonwey r., and connects
with Mde Wakanton l. Pike also traces this one, but by no name. R. R. station
Fridley is near its mouth. (See further under <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Fridley">Fridley</a>, in the index.)</p>

mouth of Rum r. Pike first passed Coon cr., right, and the most difficult rapids
he went up are those named for the same intelligent and ablutionary quadruped,
<i>Procyon lotor</i>. Coon or Racoon cr. was formerly known as Peterah cr. Wanyecha
(now Elm) cr. falls in on the left, slightly below Rum r. The latter is a
notable stream, being the main discharge of Mille Lacs, and as such having acquired
a long history. Carver called it Rum r.: "in the little tour I made about the
Falls [of St. A.], after traveling 14 m. by the side of the Mississippi, I came to a
river nearly 20 yards wide which ran from the north east, called Rum River," he
says, p. 45, ed. 1796. This was Nov. 19th, 1767, and the river has oftenest been
so designated ever since. But here is a place where the involuntary exploration
which the Sioux forced on Accault's party comes in, and the Hennepinian
canonical calendar is obtruded as usual, making the following trouble:</p>

<p class="footnote">"Eight leagues above St. Anthony of Padua's falls on the right, you find the
river of the Issati or Nadoussiou [Sioux], with a very narrow mouth, which you
can ascend to the north for about 70 leagues to Lake Buade or of the Issati
[Mille Lacs] where it rises. We gave this river the name of St. Francis,"
Shea's Henp., tr. 1880, p. 201. In French the name was R. de St. FranÃ§ois:
so Henp., map, 1683; on Franquelin's, 1688, it is "Riviere des Francois ou des
Sioux," which turns it over from the saint to the French nation, possibly less
saintly on the whole&mdash;that is, unless Franquelin intended to cover St. Francis
de Sales, St. Francis d'Assisi, and St. Francis de Paola, or unless <i>des</i> be a mis-engravement
for <i>de S</i>. But Franquelin's earlier map, 1683 or 1684, has only
R. des FranÃ§ois, which is there connected with R. de la Madelaine (St. Croix
r.) by R. du Portage, which latter stands for present Snake r., a branch of the
St. Croix. De L'Isle's map, 1703, avoids any such question by turning the river
entirely over to the Sioux; he letters R. de Mendeouacanion, <i>i. e.</i>, Mdewakantonwan
or Gens du Lac. A question affecting the identification of St. Francis
with Rum came up in Carver's time, and is still mooted. Carver says, <i>ed.
cit.</i> p. 45: "Reached the River St. Francis, near 60 miles above the Falls. To
this river Father Hennipin gave the name," etc. He reached it Nov. 21st,
1687. This is the stream next <i>above</i> Rum r. on the same side, now best known
as Elk r. But Pike's map letters "Leaf R. or S<sup>t</sup>. Francis of Carver &amp; Henepen";
Long has it S<sup>t</sup>. Francis r.; even Nicollet gives Wichaniwa or St. Francis.
Prof. N. H. Winchell remarks, Hist. Sketch Expl. and Surv. Minn., 4to,
p. 15: "On modern maps the name of St. Francis is applied to the next stream
above the Rum, and that may have been the river to which Hennepin referred
in his journal, since by a portage the route by it to lake Buade is much less than
the course by the Rum river, and the Indians may have followed that route." I
quite agree with my friend the professor that the Sioux who took charge of
Hennepin's "explorations," in spite of all the saints on the calendar, may have
brought him that way from Mille Lacs to the Mississippi; but the question is
not by what river he came; the question is, Which river did he call R. de St.
FranÃ§ois and map by this name? To me Hennepin makes it perfectly clear that
he meant Rum r. Thus he fixes it 8 leagues = 23&#8531; m. above the falls, which is
much closer to the actual position of Rum r. than such a befogged geographer
often comes; item, he makes his St. FranÃ§ois r. come from Mille Lacs, as
Rum r. does and the other one does not (at least not uninterruptedly); item, his
alternative names, r. of the Issati or Nadoussiou, point directly to Rum r.;
item, for a clincher, Hennepin's map letters R. de St. FranÃ§ois precisely along
the whole course of Rum r. from the Mississippi to Lac Buade, <i>and traces
the other river too</i>, without any name. You seldom find a case clearer than this
seems to me to be. Carver was simply mistaken in identifying Hennepin's St.
Francis with the other river instead of with his own Rum r.; and this malidentification
on Carver's part seems to have given later writers an unconscious bias
in the wrong direction; Pike makes the same mistake further on in this book.
The strongest counter-argument to my view is that I differ with Nicollet in this
case. It is always unsafe to disagree with that model of caution and precision;
but I must venture to do so in this instance. For the rest, add to the synonyms
of Rum r. the aboriginal name Iskode Wabo, as given by Nicollet, and the
variants of this phrase; also, R. de l'Eau de Vie of Pike; also, Missayguani-sibi
and Brandy r. of Beltrami. F. <i>eau de vie</i> is obviously the explanation of the
"Audevies Cr." of Lewis and Clark's map, 1814, though the stream thus
designated looks to my eye too low down for Rum r. The source of this river
is noted beyond, where the case of Mille Lacs comes up.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-8" id="Footnote_II-8" href="#FNanchor_II-8"><span class="label">[II-8]</span></a> The curious word "brelaw," elsewhere "brelau," which we owe to Pike,
is a corruption of F. <i>blaireau</i>, badger. This, of course, originally denoted the
European badger, <i>Meles taxus</i>, but was easily transferred to the generically and
specifically different American badger, <i>Taxidea americana</i>. Other forms of
similar perversity are braro, brarow, brairo, braroca, praro, prarow, etc. See
L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 64. Pike's original editor of 1807 had <i>blaireau</i>, correctly,
but Pike himself seldom got any F. word or phrase exactly right.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-9" id="Footnote_II-9" href="#FNanchor_II-9"><span class="label">[II-9]</span></a> Less than this, as Crow r. is not yet passed, though Pike is not much short
of that point. There is little to note: pass Cloquet or Clouquet isl.; camp at
head of Goodwin's isl. or foot of Dayton rapids; a small body of water to the
right called L. Itaska, not to be confounded with L. Itasca! At or near the
mouth of Crow r. Pike leaves both Hennepin and Anoka cos.; he then has
Wright on his left and Sherburne on his right. Dayton, Hennepin Co., is
at the mouth of Crow r. The crossing there was called Slater's ferry.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-10" id="Footnote_II-10" href="#FNanchor_II-10"><span class="label">[II-10]</span></a> What Pierre Rousseau called a "prairie mole" was the pocket-gopher of
this region, <i>Thomomys talpoides</i>. This was first made known to science by Dr.
John Richardson in his paper entitled "Short Characters of a few Quadrupeds
Procured on Capt. Franklin's late Expedition," published in the ZoÃ¶logical
Journal, III. No. 12, Jan.-Apr. 1828, pp. 516-520. He named it <i>Cricetus
talpoides</i>, taking this specific name from its mole-like appearance, and afterwards
called it <i>Geomys talpoides</i>, in the Fauna Boreali-Americana, I. 1829,
p. 204. Among the peculiarities of the animal, and indeed of the whole family
to which it belongs, are the strictly subterranean habits, and the possession of
large cheek-pouches external to the mouth and lined with fur inside: see
Coues and Allen, Monographs N. A. Rodentia, 1877, p. 623. The common
mole of the United States, from which Pike saw that this gopher was very different,
is <i>Scalops aquaticus</i>, of the mammalian order <i>Insectivora</i> (not <i>Rodentia</i>).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-11" id="Footnote_II-11" href="#FNanchor_II-11"><span class="label">[II-11]</span></a> To a position about halfway between Elk r., Sherburne Co., and Monticello,
Wright Co.&mdash;say Baker's ferry, at head of Dimick's or Demick's isl., and
compare <a href="#Footnote_III-29">note</a> at date of Apr. 9th. On making Dayton rapids Pike passed the
mouth of Crow r., which falls in on the left above the town and below Dayton isl.
This river rises in Green l., Kamdiyohi Co., and by various affluents elsewhere,
flows about E. through Meeker and Wright, and then turns N. E., separating the
latter from Hennepin Co. (This must not be confounded with Crow Wing r.,
much higher up the Mississippi.) It was discovered by Carver Nov. 20th, 1766,
and by him called Goose r. Beltrami chose Rook's r. Nicollet has Karishon or
Crow r. This river needed an ornithologist to keep from mixing up those birds
so! Besides the three bird-names, Beltrami produced Poanagoan-sibi or Sioux r.,
as he says it was called by the "Cypowais." Elk River, 41 m. from St. Paul by
rail, pop. 1,500, is the seat of Sherburne Co. It is situated immediately below
the mouth of Elk r. This is the stream charted by Pike with the legend "Leaf
R. or S<sup>t</sup>. Francis of Carver &amp; Henepen": see for this case <a href="#Footnote_II-7">note<sup>7</sup></a>. Pike also
calls it R. des Feuilles. Allen had St. Francis or Parallel r. Beltrami said
Kapitotigaya-sibi or Double r. Nicollet's terms Wichaniwa and St. Francis
belong to the main (East) fork of Elk r., now commonly called the St. Francis;
he names the other fork Kabitawi (which is the same word that Beltrami uses in
another form). Above Elk River is Otsego, Wright Co., with Orano's (Jameson
and Wilson) isls. below and Davis isl. above it.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-12" id="Footnote_II-12" href="#FNanchor_II-12"><span class="label">[II-12]</span></a> To vicinity of Monticello, Wright Co. In the course of the hard water
stemmed to-day are Spring rapids and Battle rapids, each of which Pike marks
"Ripple" on his map; the former is first above Dimick's isl.; the latter is above
Brown's isl. and Houghton's flats; and the name no doubt commemorates the
Indian fight of which Pike speaks. The rise represented by the hard water is
about 25 feet, bringing the Expedition up to 898 or 900 feet above sea-level.
Nicollet's Migadiwin cr. falls in on the left, just above Monticello; this is now
known as Otter cr. Boom isl. is just below the ferry at Monticello.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-13" id="Footnote_II-13" href="#FNanchor_II-13"><span class="label">[II-13]</span></a> To some obscure point about one-third of the way from Monticello to Clear
Water. It is past Lane's and Cedar isls., and above Cedar rapids, which Pike
marks "Ripple" on his map (the third such mark above his Leaf r.), and below
Silver cr.; but I cannot stick a pin in the map, as there is no named place in
the immediate vicinity; nearest probably R. R. station Lund, Wright Co.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-14" id="Footnote_II-14" href="#FNanchor_II-14"><span class="label">[II-14]</span></a> Vicinity of Clear Water r., a sizable stream which separates Wright from
Stearns Co.; Kawakomik or Clear Water r. of Nicollet; Kawakonuk r. of Owen;
Kawanibio-sibi of Beltrami; and qu. Little Lake r. of Carver's map? The
whole distance from Monticello to town of Clear Water at the mouth of this
river is only 19 m., and thence to St. Cloud, 14 m. = 33 m. for which Pike allows
12 + 20 + 3 + 16Â½ = 51Â½ m. This is over his average excess, and the case is
complicated by the position assigned for the wintering station of the persons
named on the 10th. Pike lays down Clear Water r., and his map legends, a
little <i>below</i> this, "Wintering Grounds of M<sup>r</sup>. Potier, 1797; &amp; M<sup>r</sup>. Dickson,
1805-1806." The names do not correspond exactly with the text, and as the
wintering ground of the text was not passed till the 10th, when Pike was certainly
above the Clear Water, this wintering ground is simply legended too low
on the map. Compare Apr. 7th, <a href="#Page_193">beyond</a>, when Pike reaches the post of Mr.
Dickson and the other person, there called Paulier, in one day's voyage from his
stockade on Swan r. As there explained, the post in question was only 4 m.
below the head of Pike's Beaver isls., thus in the vicinity of St. Augusta, while
Pike's station of the 8th was at or near Clear Water. To reach this town and
river Pike passes Bear isl., Smiler's rapids, and on his left two small streams.
The lower one of these is Silver cr., coming from a small lake between Silver
Creek Siding and a place called Hasty. The upper one of these is Bend cr. of
Nicollet (discharge of Fish l.), so named from falling into what was a remarkable
bend of the Mississippi, now a cut-off with a large (Boynton's) island. This
place is 3 m. below Clear Water, in Sect. 6, T. 122, R. 26, 5th M.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-15" id="Footnote_II-15" href="#FNanchor_II-15"><span class="label">[II-15]</span></a> St. Cloud, seat of Stearns Co.; population 8,000; East St. Cloud opp.;
bridges; railroads converging by five tracks; rapids of 30,000 horse-power,
dammed and utilized. This is a notable place, likely to become more so. The
whole descent from the upper part of the town of Sauk Rapids to the lower
part of St. Cloud, a distance of some 5 m., is 24 feet; of which Sauk rapids
proper fall 17 or 18 feet in the course of a mile. Pike camps at the foot of
these. "Grand Rapids" of the above text are mapped by Pike as "Big
Rapids," the term also used by Lewis and Clark; they are Nicollet's Second
rapids. When I last saw the place it was not easy to discern the natural course
of the river, it was so jammed with logging-booms. The "more than 20
islands" which Pike passed to-day are in part included in the cluster called the
Archipelago by Beltrami, now known as the Thousand isls., smallest and most
numerous in the expansion of the river just below St. Cloud and above Mosquito
rapids; the latter, not bad, are between a large island on the right and
a creek that makes in on the left (S. 36, T. 124, R. 28, 5th M.). A short distance
below these islands, probably not far from Mosquito rapids, and thus
somewhere about opposite St. Augusta, was the above-named wintering place.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-16" id="Footnote_II-16" href="#FNanchor_II-16"><span class="label">[II-16]</span></a> The whole distance by river from St. Cloud to Pike rapids, where he stops
to build his winter-quarters, is only 33 m. He makes this 8 + 12Â½ + 29 + 17 + 5 = 71Â½!
As there is no possible mistake about the place we have brought
him to, or about that where we shall drop him, an error of over 100 per cent. is
evident in the mileage of the 11th-15th. The text gives but one named point
(his Clear r.) to consider for the required adjustment; but there are seven
definite named rivers in this course and several rapids; so that we can check
him at every few miles, and only need to cut down his mileage a little more
than one-half. Camp of the 11th ("8" = 4 m.) is a little above the mouth of
Sauk r. On heading Sauk rapids, Pike passes the town of Sauk Rapids, seat
of Benton Co., 75 m. by rail from St. Paul. It is a smaller place than St.
Cloud, pop. 1,200, but enjoys the same 30,000 horse-power of the 18 feet to
the mile fall of the Miss. r. Sauk r. falls in from the W., opposite the upper part
of the town; Pike elsewhere calls it R. aux Saukes, and maps it as Sack r.; so
does Long, though he calls the Indians Sakawes and Sakawis: Nicollet's map
has Osakis r.; other variants of the name are Sac, Sacque, Saque, Sawk, Saukee,
Sawkee, Osaukee, Osauki, etc. The most elaborate way of spelling Sauk that
I have found is Sassassaouacotton. The form Ozaukee is adopted by Verwyst,
Wis. Hist. Soc., XII. 1892, p. 396, where it is said that this and Sauk are corrupted
from <i>ozagig</i>, meaning those who live at a river's mouth.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-17" id="Footnote_II-17" href="#FNanchor_II-17"><span class="label">[II-17]</span></a> About 6 m., to a position near the mouth of Little Rock r., above Watab
rapids and the town of that name in Benton Co. Pike first passes on his right,
about a mile from camp, a small stream whose name has not reached me (it
empties in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 15, T. 36, R. 31, 4th M.). In another mile he
passes Little Sauk r., a stream like its namesake, but small. This is called
Watab r. by Nicollet, Owen, and Brower, Wadub r. by Schoolcraft, Wattah r.
by Allen. This little river was formerly important as the most tangible part of
the shadowy Sioux-Chippewa boundary of 1825. Starting from the Chippewa
r., the line cut across most rivers, at odd places the savages no doubt understood,
but geographers never did. It crossed the St. Croix at "Standing Cedars"
below the falls, struck near the head of Coon cr., crossed Rum r. at or near its
principal forks, hit a "Point of Woods" somewhere, crossed Leaf (Elk) r. low
down, and reached the Mississippi opp. the mouth of the Little Sauk, <i>which
it followed up</i>, and then went N. W., passed past Swan and Little Elk rivers to
the watershed of the Red River of the North, which it followed approx. N. to
the Otter Tail and Leech l. traverse. (See Allen's map.) The "narrow rocky
place" passed is Watab rapids, and the town of Watab is just above these, on the
creek to the right, 5 m. above Sauk Rapids. Sauk and Watab are respectively the
"2nd" and "3rd" rapids of Nicollet's map. The word <i>watab</i> means <i>spruce</i>;
or, rather, as follows: "The small roots of the spruce tree afford the <i>wattap</i>,
with which the bark [of birchen canoes] is sewed; ... Bark, some spare
<i>wattap</i>, and gum, are always carried in each canoe," Alex. Henry, Travels,
1761-66, N. Y., 8vo, 1809, p. 14. In this matter we also have the support of
the highest possible authority; for the Century Dictionary, representing the
acme of English scholarship, defines <i>watap</i> or <i>watapeh</i> as "the long slender
roots of the white spruce, <i>Picea alba</i>, which are used by canoe-makers in northwestern
North America for binding together the strips of birch-bark." <i>Cf.</i>
Baraga's Otchipwe Dict., 1880, Pt. 2, p. 404, <i>s. v.</i> <i>watab</i>. Pike charts Watab
rapids; his map, place marked "Ripple," first above his "Little Sack R."
This is where his boat sprung a leak, and he did not get much further.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-18" id="Footnote_II-18" href="#FNanchor_II-18"><span class="label">[II-18]</span></a> Say about 14 m., to a position between Platte r. and Spunk r. Soon after
decamping, Pike passed a river he does not mention above, but which he elsewhere
names Lake r., and maps conspicuously in connection with a certain
small sheet of water he names Elk l. These are now known as Little Rock
r. and Little Rock l. The stream is laid down by Nicollet with the additional
name of Pikwabic r. It falls into a remarkable horseshoe bend of the river,
which has not cut off an island since the charts I use were drawn. Opposite
this bend there is a place called Brockway, in Stearns Co. Of Clear r. as above,
and also so charted by Pike, Lewis and Clark, and Allen, Pike elsewhere says
that it "is a beautiful little stream, of about 80 yards in width, and heads in
some swamps and small lakes on which the Sauteaux of Lower Red Cedar Lake
and Sandy Lake frequently come to hunt." It is Pekushino r. of Nicollet,
Bekozino-sibi and Pines Tail r. of Beltrami, now commonly called Platte r., and
occasionally Flat r., as on an 1850 map of Minnesota before me; it heads in the
region about Mille Lacs. At the place where the railroad crosses Platte or Clear
r. is Royalton, in Bellevue township, Morrison Co. One-third of a mile below
its mouth is the line between Stearns and Morrison cos., on first section-line
above town-line 126-7. One of the two rivers here noted is Cold r. of Carver,
1767; but I am uncertain which one. McNeal's ferry over the Mississippi is
about a mile below the mouth of the Platte.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-19" id="Footnote_II-19" href="#FNanchor_II-19"><span class="label">[II-19]</span></a> Making the requisite adjustment of this, we set Pike down in the N. E. Â¼
of Sect. 29, T. 128, R. 29, 5th M.; this will give us 3 m. to fill the bill of the
"five" to-morrow. To-day's itinerary furnishes some nice points which we
must determine with precision&mdash;not for their intrinsic importance, but for their
significance in connection with Pike's winter-quarters. The matter must be
attended to here, though the text has not a word about it. But Pike elsewhere
speaks of three creeks along here, above his Clear r.=Platte, and below his Pine
cr.=Swan r., near which he builds his stockade. Pike's map has four, on the
left, beginning above Clear r.: (1) Wolf cr.; (2) a creek; (3) Buffalo cr.; (4)
Rocky cr.&mdash;all names of his own, none used now. Proceeding up from Platte=Clear
r., we have on the left in succession: (1) Spunk r., whose mouth is in
the S. E. Â¼ of Sect. 22, T. 127, R. 29, 5th M. This is the Wolf cr. of Pike's,
item of Lewis and Clark's map, 1814; mapped, no name, Allen; Zakatagana-sibi
of Beltrami; Sagatagon or Spunk r. of Nicollet; Spunk brook of various
maps. The native name which we have translated means some sort of touchwood
or punk, which may be more plentiful hereabouts than elsewhere, or of
better quality. (2) A rivulet for which I can find no name, not even on the
local maps, and which is too insignificant to appear at all on most maps; Pike's
traces it without name. I will call it Maple brook, because it falls in behind
Maple isl., in Sect. 17 of the T., R., and M. last said. Maple isl. is sizable, and
locally well known; either this or the little round one close by is probably Beltrami's
"Island of the Sun." (3) Two Rivers, or Two r., or Twin r., as the
next stream is called, which empties about the center of Sect. 8 of the same T.,
R., and M., hardly a mile above Maple brook. This is the one Pike maps by the
name of Buffalo cr.; it is also Buffaloe cr. of Lewis and Clark's map; and the
Kanizotygoga of Beltrami. This is a sizable stream, giving name to Two Rivers
Township, and does not fall in behind any island. (4) Little Two Rivers, or
Two Rivers brook, which falls in about half a mile higher up, in the same
Section, behind an island. (5) A nameless and utterly insignificant brook, which
falls in at McDougal's eddy, behind an island, in the S. E. Â¼ of Sect. 5 of the
same T., R., and M. I find it correctly laid down on a Morrison Co. map, on
a scale of 2 inches to the mile; but it does not appear on the inch-to-mile charts
I mostly follow. (6) Hay cr., which most maps run into Little Two Rivers,
but which is quite distinct, with the brook (5) intervening. Hay cr. comes
southward along the E. border of Swan River township, turns S. E. across
Sect. 31 of T. 128, R. 29, thence enters Sect. 5 of T. 127, R. 29, and falls into
the Mississippi behind the three-cornered isl. which there lies opp. some rapids
next above McDougal's eddy. The only question seems to be, whether Pike's
Rocky cr. is Little Two Rivers or Hay cr.; but after pretty close scrutiny of
the country thereabouts, I incline to decide in favor of Little Two Rivers, and
could give various reasons for this identification. Pike maps four rapids, in
quick succession, above his Rocky cr. Two of these I suppose to be those now
known as Blanchard's and McDougal's, both passed on the 14th; a third is
surmounted on the 15th, but the fourth finishes Pike's boat-voyage: see <a href="#Footnote_II-20">next
note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-20" id="Footnote_II-20" href="#FNanchor_II-20"><span class="label">[II-20]</span></a> Three miles, to camp at the foot of Knife or Pike rapids, W. side of the
Mississippi, about the S. border of Sect. 7, T. 128, R. 29, 5th M. These
are the 4th or Knife rapids of Nicollet, apparently so called from the narrowness
of the two channels into which the river is divided for most of their
extent by an island, which is what Pike's text above means by the "two narrow
shoots." The designation of Pike rapids is not recent; it occurs on the Allen
map pub. 1834, and no doubt this antedates the time that the next creek above
Swan r. was named Pike cr., and the township next above Swan River township
was named Pike Creek township. The ascent is 10 or 11 feet to the mouth of
Swan r.; and this is 4 m. below the city of Little Falls. Little Falls is given
as 115 m. by the river from Minneapolis, and as 105 m. by rail from St. Paul
(N. P. R. R.). We know where Pike sleeps to-night within a few rods, and
shall be able to locate his stockade with a "probable error" of no yards, feet,
or inches.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-21" id="Footnote_II-21" href="#FNanchor_II-21"><span class="label">[II-21]</span></a> "Lieu<sup>t</sup>. Pikes, Block House or Post, for the Winter 1805-1806" is
legended on the pub. map, and marked by a zigzag line snug up under his Pine
cr. (now Swan r.). The orig. MS. map, now on file in the Engineer Office of
the War Dept., is large enough to show the exact spot, on which is delineated a
stockade 36 feet square, with a blockhouse on the N. W. and another on the
S. E. corner of the structure. Notwithstanding such precise indicia, the site
has been vaguely stated by various authors, and even shifted down to Two Rivers
by so careful and usually correct a writer as my friend the Hon. J. V. Brower,
who is clearly in error in stating that "the south branch of Two Rivers was
named Pine creek, and the other Second creek," Minn. Hist. Coll., VII., Mississippi
R. and its Source, 8vo., Minneapolis, 1893, p. 126. This is simply an
<i>obiter dictum</i>, by inadvertence. I had satisfied myself of the true site within a
few rods, when I first learned from Prof. N. H. Winchell, State Geologist of
Minnesota, that traces of the building had been discovered by Judge Nathan
Richardson, Mayor of Little Falls, Minn. On writing to this gentleman, I
received a prompt reply, as follows:</p>

<p class="footnotel45"><span class="smcap">Little Falls, Minn.</span>, Feb. 24th, 1894.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Elliott Coues, Esq., Washington, D. C.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Yours of the 21st inst. is received making inquiry about my
discovering the location of a fort built by Zebulon M. Pike in the fall of 1805.
The location is on the West bank of the Mississippi River on Government Subdivision
described as Lot No. 1, Sec. No. 7, in Township No. 128 North, of
Range No. 29 West, of the 5th Principal Meridian, near the S. E. corner of
said Lot No. 1, and near 80 rods south from the mouth of Swan river and four
miles south of this city. I settled at this place in 1855. I wrote a history of
this county in 1876. Then in 1880 I revised it. Before writing the revision in
1880 I looked over the books in our State Historical Society, where I found an
account of Pike's Expedition up into this region of country that year. His
description of the location was so plain and explicit that I had no trouble in
finding it. At that time there were no logs or timber left. The place was
plainly marked by a pile of stone, about the size of an ordinary haycock, of which
the chimney or fire-place was built. The fort was built of logs. The bottom
layer was imbedded about one-half their size into the ground when built. The
groove in the earth showed very plain when I first visited the place. As near
as I could judge the building was 40 feet square. Built just on the brink of a
slight elevation, as described by Mr. Pike in his narrative. Afterward in
speaking about the location of Pike's Fort to an old settler, Samuel Lee, now
residing at Long Prairie in this State, he told me that he had been at the place
many years before, and when he was first at the place the bottom tier of logs
were still there. I visited the spot two years ago for the purpose of getting one
of the stones that were used to build the fire-place, and took one that will weigh
about 75 pounds, which I am keeping as a relic. The pile of stone is getting
scattered about; the ground has never been cleared and broken up, but is used
as a pasture. Unless something durable is put up soon to mark the location all
trace of it will be obliterated. This country commenced to settle with farmers
in 1850, and has become quite well settled up. I will say before closing that
the rapids at the foot of which he built the fort bear the name of Pike rapids, so
named in honor of him. I will send you a copy of our extra paper [Daily
Transcript, of Little Falls], issued the 1st of January. If I have omitted anything
that you may wish to know write me again.</p>

<p class="footnotel45">Yours very respectfully,<br />
<span class="i2">[Signed]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">N. Richardson</span>.</span></p>

<p class="footnote">Judge Richardson is entitled to the credit of recovering and making known the
spot in modern times. The Hist. Up. Miss. Vall., pub. Minneap. 1881, treating
Morrison Co. in Chap. cxxxviii, has on p. 586 a short notice of the location,
presumably upon Judge Richardson's data, as the publishers' preface makes
general acknowledgments of indebtedness to him. In Oct., 1886, the place was
visited by Mr. T. H. Lewis, at the instance of Mr. A. J. Hill of St. Paul, and
through the friendly attentions of the latter I am put in possession of extracts
and tracings from Mr. Lewis' notebook, made on the spot at the date said,
when he found the extant remains. Mr. Lewis identified the site upon his own
observations, not being at the time informed of the earlier discovery. So interesting
a spot should be permanently marked before all traces of it are obliterated,
and I hope Judge Richardson will interest himself to see that this is done.
It need not be an expensive or elaborate monument; probably the stones of the

they were solidly piled up.</p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span>&mdash;<i>Little Falls, Minn.</i>, <i>Sept.</i> 8th, 1894.&mdash;I have this day visited the
spot in person, accompanied by Judge Richardson and Mrs. Coues. We have
piled up the rocks in a conspicuous heap. I do not recognize any trace of the
original woodwork, or of the ground-plan of the structure, except the place of
the chimney; but the site is unquestionable. To reach it, you go down the
main road from Little Falls, about 4 m. along the W. side of the Miss. r.,
crossing Pike cr. and next Swan r.; a few rods beyond the latter, turn to the left
into Simon Kurtzman's cornfield, through bars, and keep on due E. to the
river. You will see the cairn we have made in the following position: Sect.
7, T. 128, R. 29, 5th M., in S. E. corner of Lot No. 1, 80 rods E. of Simon
Kurtzman's house, about 80 rods S. S. E. of the mouth of Swan r., near the E.
border of the cornfield, 30 paces back from the brink of the Mississippi, 50
yards S. by E. of a lone pine tree 50 feet high, on a flat piece of high ground
in a copse of scattered scrub oaks, overgrown with brush and weeds. Letter
on the subject over my signature in Little Falls Daily Transcript, Sept. 10,
1894, urging the erection of a monument.</p>

was a flaw in the wood of which it was built, such unsoundness of timber being
called a windshock or windshake.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-23" id="Footnote_II-23" href="#FNanchor_II-23"><span class="label">[II-23]</span></a> For Dickson's trading-house of 1805-6 see <a href="#Footnote_III-28">note beyond</a>, date of Apr. 7th.
Dickson's name frequently recurs in Pike, but I think never once in full.
Robert Dickson was an Englishman who began to trade with the Sioux as
early as 1790, and acquired great renown in the early history of the country.
The following occurs in Minn. Hist. Coll., I. 2d ed. 1872, p. 390: "Five years
after Pike's visit he espoused the British cause, and took a prominent part in
encouraging the western tribes in hostility against the Americans. Yet he is
said to have been very humane to American prisoners, rescuing many from the
Indians, and restraining the latter from barbarities and cold-blooded massacres.
After the war Dickson, some accounts say, did not resume trade with the Sioux;
but he did at least live at Lake Travers as late as 1817, and was charged with
alienating the Sioux from the United States, in complicity with Lord Selkirk,
who was there establishing his colony on Red river. He was soon after arrested
near what is now St. Paul, and taken to St. Louis. He was probably soon released,
however, and found his way back to Queenstown in Canada, where he
died. Dickson had a Sioux wife and four half-breed children. One of his
grandchildren was wife of Joseph Laframboise, a well-known trader at Lac Qui
Parle." To this may be added that one of Col. Robert Dickson's half-breed
sons was William Dickson, whose name appears here and there in Minnesota
annals.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-24" id="Footnote_II-24" href="#FNanchor_II-24"><span class="label">[II-24]</span></a> There is no such French word as "killeur," which Pike elsewhere renders
"killieu," and which appears in the text of 1807 as "killien" and "killein."
On consulting the F. text, I. p. 95, I find that the editor says, "PlutÃ´t <i>tueur
rouge</i>, car le mot killeur n'est pas franÃ§ois; c'est sans doute un barbarisme Ã©chappÃ©
Ã  M. Pike." The son of this chief Pike calls "Fils de Killeur Rouge": see
<a href="#Page_179">Mar. 5th and 8th</a>, 1806, beyond. There is a Canadian French word <i>pilleur</i>,
pillager, and the Leech Lake Chippewas were known as Pilleurs or Pillagers;
but this Killeur was a Sioux chief of the Gens des Feuilles or Leaf Indians, now
called Wahpetonwans: see L. and C., ed. 1893, p. 100. Pike translates Killeur
by "Eagle"; and this clew to the meaning of the word is carried on by Beltrami,
II. p. 207, who has a chief called "Ki-han or Red Quilliou"; <i>ibid.</i>,
p. 224, he speaks of "a bird which the Canadians call <i>killiou</i>, and the Indians
Wamendi-hi"; <i>ibid.</i>, p. 307, he says "a plume of <i>killow</i>," making an English
word of it. Forsyth has "the killiew (thus named from a species of eagle)," in
Minn. Hist. Col., III. 1874, p. 154. So <i>killeur</i>, etc., is simply a French way
of spelling a certain Indian name of the eagle, whose feathers are used for
ornament. I once noted this word in the form <i>khoya</i>. Riggs' Dak. Dict.,
1852, has "<i>&#7714;u-yÃ¡</i>, <i>n.</i>, the common eagle" (the dotted <i>h</i> a deep surd guttural).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-26" id="Footnote_II-26" href="#FNanchor_II-26"><span class="label">[II-26]</span></a> More probably Chien Blanc, or White Dog&mdash;unless we could go so far as to

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-27" id="Footnote_II-27" href="#FNanchor_II-27"><span class="label">[II-27]</span></a> About opp. the mouth of Pine cr. or Swan r., Â½ m. above head of Roberts'
isl., and on or near the present site of Gregory, Morrison Co. This place is
marked as Aitkin's ferry, trading-post, and hotel, on a Minnesota map, pub.
Phila., Cowperthwait, 1850; it is about the middle of the southwesternmost
section of Little Falls township (Township 40, Range 32, 4th mer.), say 3 m.
below the middle of the city of Little Falls. The head of Pike rapids is 1,071
or 1,072 feet above sea-level. Swan r. bends up a little to fall into the Miss.
r., so that its mouth is slightly over the S. border of Sect. 6, Township 128,
Range 29, 5th mer. There is a flour mill on its S. side, at the bend, half a
mile or less from its mouth. Ledoux P. O. is on this stream, a few miles up,
in Swan River township, which lies between North Prairie township and
Pike Creek township; Swan r. runs over the N. border of it a mile W. of
the Mississippi. By whom Pike's Pine cr. was first called Swan r. I do not
know, unless it was Nicollet; it is Wabizio-sibi of Beltrami, Wabezi or Swan
r. of Nicollet, 1836, Swan r. of Owen and later writers; but Lieut. Allen
has it Elk r. on his map, by error.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-28" id="Footnote_II-28" href="#FNanchor_II-28"><span class="label">[II-28]</span></a> Less than this, to camp on left or E. bank of the Mississippi, in the present
city of Little Falls, Morrison Co., probably about the place where is the
lower bridge, a few blocks from the Buckman hotel. Painted Rock rapids is
now Little falls. A high, small island at the falls divides the river in two
channels; it is Rock isl. of Nicollet, now called Mill isl.; some mills are there,
and there is the site of the present dam, immediately below the lower bridge.
Little Falls is a flourishing place, as towns with a water-power of 35,000 horses
may easily be; pop. now or lately 3,000; dam built 1887-8, said to have cost
$250,000; two bridges span the river, the upper one for the N. P. R. R., near
the large sawmill which stands on the W. bank; chief industry, milling flour
and logs; city incorporated 1889; N. Richardson, mayor for five years: see
Little Falls Daily Transcript, Industrial ed., Jan. 1st, 1894, large folio, pp. 28,
maps and views, price 5c. The Little falls&mdash;cataract, not town&mdash;are so called
by Pike elsewhere in this work; he also says that "the place is called by the
French Le Shute de la Roche Peinture," by which we may understand La Chute
de la Roche Peinte; his map legends "Painted Rock or Little Falls." Beltrami
names the falls Great Rock and KekebicaugÃ©. As to the "5 miles" of
to-day's journey, we may note that the distance is less now than it used to be
by the channel, because there was a bend of the river to the E. which is now
straightened out. This bend appears on maps of 20 years ago; it is now city
ground, and the march of improvement has effected various other changes in the
course of the river. When about a mile from this morning's camp, Pike passed
a place where the river was fordable, and may be so still; here was the site of
Swan River P. O., on the E. bank, in Little Falls township. When a mile further
on, he passed the mouth of a creek from the W. which he calls 2nd cr. (on
the map "2<sup>d</sup> Cr."), and which others have rendered Second cr., though Nicollet
and Owen both have it Little Fall cr.; it is now known as Pike cr., and
gives name to Pike Creek township. It falls into the Mississippi at the middle
of the E. border of Sect. 25, Township 129, Range 30, 5th mer., through
the 6th one of the 16 outlots of O. O. Searles, slightly beyond present city
limits.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-29" id="Footnote_II-29" href="#FNanchor_II-29"><span class="label">[II-29]</span></a> To a position at the head of Little Elk rapids, a short distance above the
mouth of Little Elk r. This is a sizable stream which comes from the W.
through Parker and Randall townships to the S. W. corner of Green Prairie
township, touches the N. E. corner of Pike creek township, and then curves a
couple of miles to the Mississippi through Sects. 6 and 5, T. 129, R. 29,
5th M. Pike elsewhere notes it with particularity by the name of Elk r. Beltrami
says Moska or Mosko and Doe or Bitch r. This last name is a mistaken
rendering of R. la Biche or Elk r. of the French&mdash;he makes the same singular
blunder in the case of Lake Itasca, which he calls Doe or Bitch l., after the
French Lac la Biche. The river is the Omoshkos or Elk r. of Nicollet
and Owen. It is marked Little Fork cr. on the Minn. map of 1850; and
Allen's map makes it Swan r., by an erroneous transposition of names; see
<a href="#Footnote_II-27">note<sup>27</sup></a> p. 122.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-30" id="Footnote_II-30" href="#FNanchor_II-30"><span class="label">[II-30]</span></a> From Little Falls to Crow Wing is only 26 m. by the river. Pike does
not reach Crow Wing till the 21st, and his party does not get up till the 23d
or 24th. Exactly what distance he makes it cannot be said, as mileage is
missing some days. He appears to have thought it some 50 or 60 m. Thus
the itinerary does not afford data for fixing camps with precision, and hence we
can only check him approximately from day to day. The sledge-party does not
average 3 m. a day, but Pike himself seems to skirmish about for many more
miles&mdash;perhaps the excessive mileages represent his own activities, not the actual
advance of the Expedition. The average course is due N. On the 12th Conradi
shoal and Belle Prairie were passed, to camp in the vicinity of Fletcher cr.
Belle Prairie is a comparatively old settlement on the E. bank, founded by
Frederick Ayer, a missionary, in 1848; pop. 800. This is only 4Â½ m. by rail
from Little Falls. The town is directly opposite the shoals. These are the
Fifth rapid of Nicollet. A small creek comes in opposite them from the W.,
in Green Prairie township. Fletcher cr. is mapped by Nicollet without name;
it is McKinney's r. on the 1850 map of Minn. It falls in from the E. through
Sect. 1, T. 41, R. 32, 4th M.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-31" id="Footnote_II-31" href="#FNanchor_II-31"><span class="label">[II-31]</span></a> In the vicinity of Topeka, a town and station on the N. P. R. R., on the
E. bank of the river.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-32" id="Footnote_II-32" href="#FNanchor_II-32"><span class="label">[II-32]</span></a> Camp of the 14th, 15th, and 16th seems to have been on the W. bank of
the river, at the head of Olmsted's bar, and was very likely opp. the point
of land in Sect. 15, T. 42, R. 32, 4th M., where one Baker located his
trading-house in 1831. It is formally named Pine camp when it is passed on
the way down, Mar. 4th, 1806: see <a href="#Mar4">that date</a>. Olmsted's bar is the Sixth rapid
of Nicollet, at a place where the river expands and contains a cluster of small
islands, called The Sirens by Beltrami, II. p. 466.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-33" id="Footnote_II-33" href="#FNanchor_II-33"><span class="label">[II-33]</span></a> This cache was in the vicinity of present Fort Ripley. The town now so
called is on the E. side; railroad; pop. 500. Old Fort Ripley itself is
on the W. side, a mile off; some of the buildings still stand. This post, or
another in the same place, was once called Fort Gaines; Prairie PercÃ©e of the F.
intersected the river a little below. The fort is in the N. E. Â¼ of Sect. 7, T.
131, R. 29, 5th M., about a half mile below the mouth of Nokasippi r., which
falls in from the E. through Sect. 27, T. 43, R. 32, 4th M. This is a
considerable stream: Nokasippi and Noka Sipi of Schoolcraft; Nokay r. of
Nicollet and of Owen; Nokasele on one of my maps, Nankesele and Nankele
on others; Woco-sibi of Beltrami's text, II. p. 466, Wokeosiby and Prophet r.
on his map. This hint that the name is a personal one is correct. Noka was
a Chippewa, the grandfather of White Fisher or Waubojeeg. "It is from this
old warrior and stalwart hunter, who fearlessly passed his summers on the string
of lakes which form the head of the No-ka river, which empties into the Mississippi
nearly opposite present site of Fort Ripley, that the name of this stream
is derived," says W. W. Warren, Minn. Hist. Coll., V. 1885, p. 266. It is
mapped by Pike and mentioned by him beyond at date of Mar. 3d, 1806; but
he has no name for it. Allen's map gives it as Long r. But the earliest name
of the stream I can discover is on Lewis and Clark's map, pub. 1814, where it
is called Scrub Oak r., no doubt from the prairie above it, to which Pike gave
that name. On reaching ownline 42-3, Pike leaves Morrison for Crow Wing
Co., on the right, but still has the former on his left, up to Crow Wing r.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-34" id="Footnote_II-34" href="#FNanchor_II-34"><span class="label">[II-34]</span></a> To some point probably more than halfway between the Nokasippi and
Crow Wing rivers, perhaps not far from the station or siding Albion (St. Paul
Div. of N. P. R. R.). It is beyond Lenox, and a little above that creek for
which I find no name, but which falls in from the W. through Sect. 24, T. 132,
R. 30, 5th M.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-35" id="Footnote_II-35" href="#FNanchor_II-35"><span class="label">[II-35]</span></a> To a position immediately below the mouth of the Crow Wing r.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-36" id="Footnote_II-36" href="#FNanchor_II-36"><span class="label">[II-36]</span></a> RiviÃ¨re Ã  l'Aile de Corbeau of the F., usually shortened into R. de Corbeau,
though Eng. Crow Wing r. reflects the full name. The large island at its mouth
was called Isle or Ãle de Corbeau, and I suspect that the similarity of <i>aile</i> and
<i>isle</i> or <i>Ã®le</i> may be concerned in this nomenclature. The river sometimes appears
as Crow r., rendering the shorter F. form; in such instance it must not be confounded
with Crow r. much lower down the Mississippi: see <a href="#Footnote_II-11">note<sup>11</sup></a>, p. 97.
Crow Wing also appears as Crow-wing, and I have found both Cow-wing and
Crowing r. in Schoolcraft. Raven r. is another name; Pike sometimes uses
this. Beltrami has Raven's Plume r. and Crow Feather r. Nicollet calls it
Kagiwan r. This is the largest branch of the Mississippi above Little Falls.
The unnumbered affluents which unite to compose the main stream head in
lakes and marshes of Hubbard, Becker, Otter Tail, Wadena, and Todd cos.
Having received most of its tributaries, and coursed through Wadena, the river
for a short distance separates Todd from Cass Co., and then runs between Cass
and Morrison to empty opp. the town of Crow Wing. Crow Wing r. was important
as a means of communication between the Mississippi and Red River of
the North. It was navigated up to the mouth of R. des Feuilles, now Leaf r., in
the S. part of Wadena Co.; thence the route was up Leaf r., and by portage
into Otter Tail l., one of the principal sources of Red r. waters. Crow Wing r.
was also a route to Leech l. Schoolcraft made the trip this way from Leech l.
to the Miss. r. in July, 1832; his map, pub. 1834, letters some of the main
branches Kioshk r., Longprairie or Warwater r., and Leaf r. The chain of
lakes on this route are in his nomenclature as follows, from below upward:
1. Kaichibo Sagitowa; 2. Johnston's; 3. Allen's; 4. Longrice (Long Rice);
5. Summit; 6. Vieux Desert; 7. Ossowa; 8. PlÃ©; 9. Birth; 10. Little Vermillion;
11. Kaginogumag, source of the river. Four small ones thence to
Leech l. are called Lake of the Island, Lake of the Mountain, Little Long
l., and Warpool l. The branch which Schoolcraft calls KÃ­osh is Nicollet's
Gayashk r., now called Gull r.; a lake on it has the same name, and one higher
up is Lake Sibley of Nicollet. Nicollet says that he contracted Gayashk from
Chip. Kagayashkensikang, "the place where there are little gulls [terns],"
Rep. 1843, p. 54. Gull r. comes from the N., approx. parallel with the Mississippi,
and falls into Crow Wing r. only some 3 or 4 m. above its mouth; about
the same distance up it is crossed by the N. P. R. R., at or near Gull River
station (between Baxter and Sylvan Lake stations).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-37" id="Footnote_II-37" href="#FNanchor_II-37"><span class="label">[II-37]</span></a> This seems to bring the whole party up to Crow Wing isl., opp. old town of
Crow Wing. Pike says himself that he could scarcely make his notes intelligible,
but we certainly know where he is to-day, and have probably checked him
from Little Falls with all the accuracy the case admits. The town was mainly
in Sect. 24, T. 44, R. 32, 4th M., but settlements in 1857 were in Sect. 23;
pop. in 1866, 600; Brainerd killed the place about 1870: see Harper's Mag.,
XIX. 1859, p. 47. Thos. Cowperthwait's map of Minn., Phila., 1850, letters
"Morrison's" on the town site.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-38" id="Footnote_II-38" href="#FNanchor_II-38"><span class="label">[II-38]</span></a> "Hard W." is a misprint for N., the general course of the river as you
ascend, for many miles, till the Crow Wing is reached; after this the Mississippi
bears N. E.; and as the Crow Wing comes in from the W., and is very
large, their confluence is, as it were, the forks of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-39" id="Footnote_II-39" href="#FNanchor_II-39"><span class="label">[II-39]</span></a> The whole way by river from Crow Wing to Pine r. (the next place where
we can certainly check Pike), is only 34 m. He makes it 10Â½ + 3 + 3 + 10 +
12 + 21 + 12 = 71Â½ m., with something over for morning of Dec. 31st. Hence
we have to cut him down about half. His "10Â½" m. takes him about 6 m.
toward Brainerd, with nothing to note on the way, excepting a small creek
on the left hand, in Sect. 26, T. 133, R. 29, 5th M. From Crow Wing to
Brainerd is 11Â¼ m. by the river; Crow Wing Co. continues on the right;
on the left is Cass Co., according to such a presumably authoritative map
as that of the G. L. O., 1893; but in fact Crow Wing Co. also extends on the
left-hand side of the Mississippi from a point about 1Â½ m. above the mouth of
Crow Wing r. upward for many miles, its W. border being along the middle
line of R. 29.</p>

of the river furnishing perhaps 20,000 horse-power; water-works, electric lights,
etc. It is a center of the lumber interests, and a focus of roads from every
direction; the river is bridged, and the surplus population forms West Brainerd.
Brainerd was laid out by the railroad in 1870, and has no earlier history.</p>

from another of the same name higher up on the same side; also,

They are close together; each is about 2 m. long and at one point only a mile
or so to the left of the river. Lake Taliaferro of Nicollet is on this connection,
but further off. Pike is fairly within the great lacustrine region of Minnesota,
where there are more lakes than have ever been counted. Half Moon l.
is a little one, about half a mile below the discharge of Duck and Swamp lakes.
The most notable point Pike passes to-day is the mouth of Rabbit r., on the
right. This is a considerable stream discharging from a set of lakes (one at
least of which has the same name), at the junction of Sects. 13 and 24, T.
46, R. 30, 4th M., at or near the foot of Island rapids. A smaller creek, also

Co., falling in from the N. in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 25, T. 136, R. 27,
5th M., at a sharp bend the Mississippi here makes. Pine r. has been so
called by pretty nearly all writers since Pike's time; but Beltrami has it Singuoako
or Pines r. It is connected directly, or indirectly, with an immense number
of small lakes, not all of which have ever been counted, and still fewer
named. Two of the largest are called Whitefish and Pelican. This whole
system of waters lies to the N. and W. of the Mississippi, S. of Leech lake,
and on Pike's left as he ascends. It offered a means of communication with
Leech lake much more direct than the course of the Mississippi itself; this was
taken by Pike on his return journey, and the river is consequently to be particularly
noted in that connection: see under dates of <a href="#Page_173">Feb. 19th-24th</a>, beyond.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-46" id="Footnote_II-46" href="#FNanchor_II-46"><span class="label">[II-46]</span></a> Curly Head does not appear in Pike's tabular exhibit of Chippewa chiefs,
and we are left without his native name, or any fair identification; but Hon.
W. W. Warren supplies the requisite data, Minn. Hist. Coll., V. 1885, p. 47,
p. 348 <i>seq.</i>, p. 366; see also <i>ibid.</i> p. 469 <i>seq.</i> and p. 495. The name of the
old civil and military chief Babesigaundibay is inseparably linked with the
history of his tribe. He belonged to the Businause family, or Crane totem, and
ruled for many years over the Chippewas of the Mississippi r., in the vicinity
of Gayashk or Gull l., eventually becoming the third man in importance in
the councils of his nation, sharing honors with Broken Tooth of Sandy l. and
Flat Mouth of Leech l. His people increased in numbers, held the Crow
Wing region against all enemies, and in 1852 numbered about 600. Curly Head
was respected and beloved; "he was a father to his people; they looked on
him as children do to a parent; and his lightest wish was immediately performed.
His lodge was ever full of meat, to which the hungry and destitute
were ever welcome. The traders vied with one another who should treat him
best, and the presents which he received at their hands he always distributed to
his people without reserve." This estimable man died on his way back from
the grand conference held at Prairie du Chien by Governors William Clark and
Lewis Cass, Aug. 19th, 1825. His signature to this treaty, as printed in one of
the copies before me, is "Babaseekeendase, Curling Hair." I elsewhere find
Babikesundeba. Curly Head died childless; on his death-bed he called two of
his pipe-bearers and formally constituted them his successors. These were
brothers; one was Songukumigor, Strong Ground, and the other Pugonakeshig,
or Hole in the Day I. The latter exerted great influence for about a quarter of
a century, killed 36 people, and was killed by being bounced out of a cart
while drunk, near Platte r., Benton Co., Minn., early in 1847.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-47" id="Footnote_II-47" href="#FNanchor_II-47"><span class="label">[II-47]</span></a> No mileage from Dec. 31st, 1805, to Jan. 3d, 1806: so we must check Pike
by other data. From Pine r. to town of Aitkin, Aitkin Co., is 32Â½ m. by
river; this is very tortuous; air-line distance between these points, 16Â¼ m., or
just one-half of the river-miles. At 12 of these direct miles' distance above
Pine r. and 4Â¼ below Aitkin is our most important datum-point, viz., mouth
of Lower Red Cedar r. This is the discharge of Lower Red Cedar l., a comparatively
large body of water 6 m. to the right (nearly S. from the mouth of
L. R. C. r.). On the shore of L. R. C. l., half a mile E. S. E. of the place where
the river issues from it, was the post of the N. W. Co., whence the party that
met Pike on the 2d came to see what was up, and to which Pike repairs as Mr.
Grant's guest on the 3d. While it is true that these facts do not fix the three
camps with all desirable precision, they enable us to carry Pike on by "rule of
thumb" in an intelligible manner. I propose, therefore, to set him one-third
of the way from Pine r. to Lower Red Cedar r. on the 31st of Dec.&mdash;say opp.
Rabbit l.; two-thirds of this way on the 1st of Jan.&mdash;some point between
Dean cr. and Hay cr., both of which fall in on the left (probably a mile above
Dean cr.&mdash;see <a href="#Page_175">Feb. 24th</a>, beyond); at mouth of Lower Red Cedar r., Jan. 2d;
at Aitkin Jan. 3d&mdash;to reach which Little Willow r., flowing S. from Waukenabo
and Esquagamau lakes, is passed. These stages cannot in any event be far out
of the way; and to so make them brings up all the points worth noting between
Pine r. and Aitkin in orderly sequence. The principal ones are the lake and
the town. The lake has been well known since the days of the old French
rÃ©gime; its relations with Mille Lacs are intimate, and it was thus of consequence
in connection with old canoe-routes; it was for many years also the situation of
important trading-posts. It was le <i>Bas</i> Lac aux CÃ¨dres Rouges of the French,
<i>Lower</i> Red Cedar l., in distinction from another one of similar name, now
Cass l. The distinction is to be sedulously borne in mind, especially as Pike
most often ignores it formally, and repeatedly speaks of "Red Cedar" or
"Cedar" l. indifferently, meaning the present one when he is hereabouts,
and meaning Cass l. when he is thereabouts; the name is also now commonly
clipped down to Cedar l. and Cedar r. or cr., meaning this one, in modern
geographies and guide-books. Lower Red Cedar l. is large, with perhaps 50 m.
of shore-line altogether; it bears from Aitkin in the direction of Brainerd;
some of its relations are with smaller bodies of water known as Crystal l., Mud
l., Spirit l., Hanging Kettle l., Pine l., Farm Island l., and Sesabagomag l.
Cedar Lake station is about 5 m. W. of Aitkin, N. P. R. R. Aitkin is per
schedule by rail 27 m. from Brainerd, 87 m. from Duluth; population 1,000;
for persons named Aitkin (not Aiken or Aitken), see <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Aitkin">that word</a> in the Index.
The present town is on the right hand going up, left or S. side of the Mississippi,
at the mouth of Mud or Muddy r. (Ripple cr.), a considerable stream,
connected with a system of small lakes. It falls into the Mississippi in Sect.
1, T. 47, R. 27, 4th M.; and in this same section is the mouth of a stream
which Owen called Sesabagomag r., but which I find given as Missagony r. on
late maps. Nicollet charted it, with no name. Below the mouth of Lower
Red Cedar r. Pike goes from Crow Wing into Aitkin Co. He had passed the
county line Jan. 3d.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-48" id="Footnote_II-48" href="#FNanchor_II-48"><span class="label">[II-48]</span></a> "Point" as a measure of distance is not a well-known term, and I am not
sure of what it means. There is some internal evidence in Pike that one of his
"points" was from &#8539; to Â¼ to Â½ m., according to the nature of the ground
and the degree of "that tired feeling" which is liable to overcome the most
pushing wayfarer. I imagine "point" to correspond to the <i>pause</i> or <i>pose</i> of the
voyageurs. In their language a <i>piece</i> was a package of any goods, made up to
weigh from 50 to 100 lbs., supposed to weigh about 90 on an average, for convenience
of transportation over portages. Such a pack would be slung on the
shoulders by the <i>fillet</i> or forehead strap; and the voyageur would start off
at a dog-trot and drop it when he got tired. This stop or rest was the <i>pose</i>;
the Chip. name was <i>opuggiddiwanan</i>, lit. the place of putting down the pack.
Pike had to the last degree the first qualification of a traveler&mdash;"go"; people
who lack plenty of that should stay at home. That he was a prudent or
judicious traveler can hardly be said; he must have been a terrible fellow to
push, merciless on his men, and especially on himself. He took all the
chances <i>per aspera</i>, when some of the roughest things might have been
smoothed or avoided had his foresight been as good as his hindsight. He blew
up things with gunpowder once, and it is a wonder he was not blown up on the
4th, instead of being only burnt out. He missed very few of the accidents that
the spirits of fire, air, earth, and water could conspire to throw in his way; and
his faithless sergeant made away with all the spirits he had in the keg at
Swan r. However, he got through all right, and got his men all through too&mdash;<i>sic
iter ad astra</i>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-49" id="Footnote_II-49" href="#FNanchor_II-49"><span class="label">[II-49]</span></a> The direct distance from Aitkin to the site of the N. W. Co. house, at least
1 m. S. of the outlet of Sandy l., is about 24 m.; the river is also pretty direct
as a whole, between these two places; but it is extremely tortuous in its many
minor bends of a mile or two apiece, so that the distance the sledges traveled
on the ice may have been twice as far as that by the way Pike and Bradley
forged ahead. These two reached Mr. Grant's house on the night of the 8th;
the men with the sledges, not till evening of the 13th. The two sets of camps
might be arbitrarily set along this lap, by ignoring such wild figures as "27
miles" for the 5th, and assuming other data. But this would probably not help
us to a better understanding of this section of the route than the following
notes: 1. Less than a mile above the mouth of Mud r. (Aitkin) a stream falls
in on the right; this is Missagony r., marked Sesabagomag r. on Owen's map.
2. Rice r. (Manomin r. of Nicollet's map) falls in on the right, 4Â½ m. in
an air-line above the mouth of Mud r., in Sect. 4, T. 47, R. 26, 4th M.
3. Willow r. falls in on the left, 6 m. in an air-line above the mouth of
Rice r., in Sect. 2, T. 48, R. 26, 4th M. This is to be particularly noted in
connection with Pike's journey, as he proceeds approximately by way of this
river from Sandy l. to Grand Rapids in the vicinity of Pokegama falls. It is
the largest tributary of the Mississippi on that side between Pine r. and the
Leech Lake branch of the Mississippi. Pike charts it by the name of Pike r.&mdash;not
his own name, as Beltrami implies, II. p. 446, but that of the pike, a fish,
translating F. RiviÃ¨re du Brochet; it is also Pike r. of Long's map; it was
called Alder r. by Cass and Meaogeo r. by Beltrami; but it is now always
known as Willow r. Its system of lakes is also in close relation with those E.
and S. E. of Leech l., and the river was thus one of the recognized routes between
this lake and the Mississippi. Its mouth is about one-third of the direct
distance between Aitkin and Sandy lake. 4. There are some rapids above
Willow r., two of them called Moose and Sandy Lake rapids; the latter are
only about 2Â½ m. direct W. from the lake, but fully 6 m. by the bends
of the river; the town of Portage is near them. Pike and Bradley left the river
at some point below these rapids, to make straight for the lake. 5. Sandy l.,
Lac au Sable or de Sable of the French, is close to the river, on the right
hand going up, and discharges into the Mississippi by a short crooked stream
called Sandy Lake r., 2 m. or less in length. Its greatest diameter in any
direction is probably under 5 m., but the figure is so irregular, with such
extensive projections into the main body of waters, that the actual shore-line
is more than 30 m. It receives the discharges of a number of smaller lakes
in the vicinity, among them one called Aitkin by Nicollet. Its principal
feeders are two in number. One of these comes in at the southernmost end of
the lake, and takes the name of Sandy, Sandy Lake, or Rice Lake r. The
N. P. R. R. crosses this stream near McGregor, which is 12 m. by the
wagon-road southward from the discharge of the lake. This river has a main
branch from Manomin or Rice l.; and either this branch or the whole river is
the Menomeny-sibi or Wild Oats r. of Beltrami. The other main affluent of
Sandy l. comes in from the E., at a point on the E. shore in the N. E. Â¼ of
Sect. 9, T. 49, R. 23, 4th M., and is generally known as Prairie r. Nicollet
called it Little Prairie r.; Long, Savanna r. Its main branch from the N. E. is
now known as Savanna r.; Nicollet called this West Savannah r. to distinguish it
from that branch of the St. Louis r. which he designated East Savannah r., and
accentuate the relations of the two. For it must be known that these rivers of
the Mississippian basin connect so closely with certain branches of the St.
Louis, in the Lake Superior basin, that they were formerly of the utmost importance
as waterways between the two great systems, and as such were greatly
used by the early voyageurs. The N. W. Co. house where Pike was entertained
stood on the W. shore of Sandy l., next to the Mississippi. Pike marks
the site on his map, and gives it as 1Â¼ m. S. of the discharge of the lake into
the short thoroughfare by which this reaches the Mississippi. There are existing
remains of old settlements in various positions further south. A trail from
the Indian village struck the Mississippi r. in the S. E. Â¼ of Sect. 4, T. 49,
R. 24. When David Thompson was here in 1798, he made the fort to be lat.
46Â° 46Â´ 39Â´Â´ N., long. 93Â° 20Â´ W. It was a point of commercial and even political
importance long before Pike's day&mdash;it was such at the pivotal date, 1763, in the
history of French-English occupancy of the Upper Mississippi. At the discharge
of the lake into the Mississippi on the N. side, in the center of Sect. 25, T. 50,
R. 24, is a small sharp point; this was the site of a post of the Amer. Fur Co.
of which Schoolcraft speaks in 1832; Palmburg was and Libby is there now.
It would be a pity if the government dam now constructing on the outlet should
convert this beautiful sheet of water into such a dismal cesspool as Lake Winnibigoshish
has become since that was dammed; but lumberjacks prevail in
northern Minnesota by a large majority, and logging-booms have nothing in
common with scenic effects.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-50" id="Footnote_II-50" href="#FNanchor_II-50"><span class="label">[II-50]</span></a> In the summer of 1802, the Morrison party, consisting of William Morrison,
the brothers Michael and Antoine Cheniers, John McBean, one Bouvin,
and one Grignon, came into the country in the service of the X. Y. Co. (Richardson
&amp; Co.), in opposition to the N. W. Co. The genuine Morrison letter
elsewhere cited, in connection with the discovery of the Mississippian source,
says: "I found ... Sayers at Leech Lake, Cotton at Fond du Lac, <i>and
Bousquai at Sandy Lake</i>." The latter is no doubt Pike's "Charles Brusky."
The name stands Bousky in Pike's text of 1807, p. 34. The Rev. Mr. Neill,
Minn. Hist. Coll., V. 1885, p. 451, speaks of the visit of David Thompson, May
6th, 1798, to Sandy Lake, adding, "where the post was in charge of Mr. BruskÃ©"
(<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Bruske">Bruske</a> in the index).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-51" id="Footnote_II-51" href="#FNanchor_II-51"><span class="label">[II-51]</span></a> See <a href="#Footnote_II-49">note<sup>49</sup></a>, p. 137, for Willow r. Pike calls it "Leech Lake river" in this
place, not because that was then or ever has been its name, but because it was
on the route he was going to take from Sandy l. to Leech l. He flatters our
intelligence further by giving us a perfectly blind snow-shoe trail, for the most
part 'cross lots, without a single compass-point, with wild mileage or none,
and not even a geographical hint, from the 20th to the 26th. He takes it for
granted that we know all about the swamps of N. Minnesota in midwinter.
Luckily, we are not without the means of bringing him to book. He continues
on the Willow River route toward Leech l. with his whole party till the morning
of the 26th, when he leaves the party to follow up that route, and goes himself
with Boley and the Indian to Mr. Grant's house "on the Mississippi." The
Mississippi is a pretty long river, but it happens that we can discover where Mr.
Grant's was in 1805: see Pike's map, place marked "N. W. C<sup>o</sup>.", on the
right bank (W. side) of the river, a little below the place marked "Ripple."
This was directly opposite the present town of Grand Rapids, Itasca Co., 3 m.
below Pokegama Falls. The air-line distance from the outlet of Sandy l.
to Grand Rapids is supposed to be 32&#8533; m.; by the way Pike went perhaps
40-45 m. The course is about N. N. W. This cuts off a considerable segment
from the winding course of the Mississippi, which makes a large elbow eastward.
Pike subtends this bend; having crossed the Mississippi near Sandy l.,
and thus continued across what he calls the "portage" to Willow r., he
goes up this, not far from parallel with the Mississippi, till Willow r. bears
more to the left; when he leaves it to continue his course to Mr. Grant's house,
having the Mississippi on his right, but at several (say 5 to 10) miles' distance,
representing the amount of cut-off he makes. On the 26th, with Boley and an
Indian, he forges ahead of his party, who do not get up to Grant's house till
the evening of the 28th, though he is there on the night of the 26th with the
Indian, and Boley comes up on the morning of the 27th. That section of the
Mississippi which Pike thus avoids may be passed over briefly, as it offers little
of interest. There are some rapids above Sandy l. Three of these are duly
charted by Nicollet, being his lower, middle, and upper "Small" rapids,
respectively now known as Ox-portage, Crooked, and Pine rapids. The first of
these are in Sect. 2, T. 50, R. 24, 4th M.: the others in the next township
above, of the same range. By far the most important tributary of the Mississippi
in this portion of its course is Swan r., which falls in from the E. in Sect.
9, T. 52, R. 24, 4th M., 1Â¼ m. (direct) south of the boundary line between
Aitkin and Itasca cos., which here runs on the line between T. 52 and T.
53. The Duluth and Winnipeg R. R. from Duluth meanders the St. Louis r.
as far as Floodwood, continues N. W. to Wawana, along some tributaries of
Floodwood r., to the divide between Laurentian and Mississippian waters in the
vicinity of Swan r. The latter is marked "Wild Swan R." on the U.Â S. Engineers'
chart&mdash;which is well enough, as all the swans in that country are wild,
though this name apparently arose from misunderstanding the legend "W. Swan
R." on Nicollet's map. This stands for <i>West</i>&mdash;not Wild&mdash;Swan r., and Nicollet
meant by it to contrast this stream with that tributary of the St. Louis which
he called East Swan r. At a distance of 6Â½ air-line miles, but fully 14 m.
by the meanders of the Mississippi, above the mouth of Swan r., a small stream
comes in from the W., nearly if not exactly on the common corner of Sects. 21,
22, 27 and 28 of T. 53, R. 24, 4th M. This is Split Hand r.&mdash;the Cut Hand
cr. of Nicollet and of Owen, draining from a lake of the same incisive name,
from Willibob l., and some others, all of which lie southeastward of the
large Lake Pokegama. This is the stream called by Beltrami Singonki-sibi or
Marten r. Above Split Hand r. are several streams on either hand. The one
which I take to be Nicollet's Blueberry cr. falls in from the E. in the S. W. Â¼
of Sect. 21, T. 54, R. 24, 4th M., Â¾ of a mile due S. of a considerable hill in
the next section above, and 3 m. due E. of Hale l.&mdash;that little lake which is at
the tip of the longest eastward finger of Lake Pokegama. Ascending the Mississippi
still, we next come to Trout r. or cr., from the E., whose mouth falls in
the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 5 of the township just said. This has held its present
name since the days of Schoolcraft and Allen, though Beltrami called it
Namago-sibi. Here we are already approaching Grand Rapids, where we shall
find Pike: for the many important features of that vicinity see <a href="#Footnote_II-52">next note</a>.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-52" id="Footnote_II-52" href="#FNanchor_II-52"><span class="label">[II-52]</span></a> I do not know that the exact site of Grant's N. W. Co. House has been
recovered of late years; but there is no question of its location nearly or directly
opposite the town of Grand Rapids, somewhere in the S. Â½ of Sect. 21, T. 55,
R. 25, 4th M. It doubtless stood on the first rising ground from the river&mdash;most
probably, as I think, on the knoll that overlooks that curious expansion of
the Mississippi into a pair of ponds or one small lake of hour-glass shape, across
the constricted part of which the river flows. Grand Rapids is the seat of
Itasca Co., and has become quite a town of late years, at least in comparison
with any others for many miles thereabouts. It stands across the mouth of a
small creek, whose name, if it have one, I could not learn, even when I was on
the spot. It discharges from several small lakes. The rapids from which the
town takes its name are not particularly "grand." Pike calls them a "ripple."
"<i>Kakabikons</i> (or simply <i>Kabikons</i>) rapids, as I have laid them down on the map,
have a fall of 9 feet in a distance of 80 yards," Nicollet, Rep. 1843, p. 63. The
volatile Beltrami calls them "Sassicy-Woenne, or Thundering Rapids," II. p. 455.
The Engineer chart marks the rapids 1247 below and 1252 above&mdash;a difference
of only 5 feet. At the direct distance of 2Â½ m. below (E. S. E. of) the town is a
village called La Prairie, of no consequence in itself, but occupying a notable place.
This is the mouth of a comparatively large river, charted by Pike as "Meadow
R. navigable for Bark Canoes 100 M." Long also maps it as Meadow r.; by
Beltrami it is called Mushkotensoi-sibi or Prairie r., and this last is its present
designation (duplicating the name of one of the tributaries of Sandy l.: see
<a href="#Footnote_II-49">note<sup>49</sup></a>, p. 138). It is the translation of the Indian word which Nicollet in this
connection renders Mashkudens, and which occurs in many forms, as Mascouten,
Muscatine, etc. About 2 m. S. W. of Grand Rapids is Horseshoe l., one of
the many small bodies of water which hover like satellites about Lake Pokegama:
see <a href="#Footnote_II-53">next note</a>. The D. and W. R. R. keeps on the N. side of the
Mississippi, from La Prairie through Grand Rapids to Cohasset and Deer River,
its present terminus.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-53" id="Footnote_II-53" href="#FNanchor_II-53"><span class="label">[II-53]</span></a> Jan. 29th and 30th are not entered in the diary, and there is intrinsic evidence
of confusion in Pike's notes. Observe the statement made under "Feb.
1st" that Pike reached Leech l. at 2.30 p. m., crossed it to the house and
arrived there about 3 p. m.&mdash;12 m. in about half an hour, an obvious impossibility.
Observe also that Boley was his only soldier according to Jan. 26th and
27th; but that Miller was the man with him on the 28th and later days. What
became of Boley and where did Miller come from? We have not a word about
the main party; in fact we are never told by what route they reached Leech l.&mdash;simply
that they got there five days after Pike, at 4 p. m., Feb. 6th: see that
date. Fortunately the early text of 1807, pp. 37-40, clears the whole matter
up, as follows: "After the whole party had arrived at this lodge [Grant's house,
evening of <i>Jan. 28th</i>], Mr. Pike determined to proceed on to the head of the
river [Leech l.], accompanied by one of his young men, named Miller. He
left the camp on the morning of the <i>29th</i>, when it was snowing very fast," etc.,
reached Pokegama falls at 1 p. m.; soon after found three deserted Chippewa
lodges, and "a fine parcel of split wood"; cut down three balsam-firs to make
a shelter, and camped. <i>Jan. 30th</i>, passed through the "dismal cypress
swamp," found Mr. Grant's cut-off and reached the inhospitable Chippewas,
who were living at or near White Oak pt. (All this is given on the 28th in
the above text; this is where the break was made, though there is no break in
the week-days, for the entry "Tuesday, Jan. 28th," covers that day, Wednesday
29th, and Thursday 30th, as shown by what I have bracketed in the text.) <i>Jan.
31st</i>, Pike and Miller continued on from White Oak pt. and went past the
mouth of the Leech Lake fork to some point on that fork, described above as
"one mile below [<i>i. e.</i> beyond] the traverse of the meadow," in the 1807 text
as "a mile above the meadow"; camped there. <i>Feb. 1st</i>, reached Leech l.
"a little after midday," p. 39 of the 1807 text, agreeing with 2.30 p. m. of above
text well enough; across the lake it was "12 miles" to the establishment of the
North West Company, at <i>which they arrived about ten o'clock in the evening</i>.
"The gates were locked," etc., p. 40.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-54" id="Footnote_II-54" href="#FNanchor_II-54"><span class="label">[II-54]</span></a> Pike has now (Jan. 29th and 30th) gone up the Mississippi from Grand
Rapids to White Oak pt.&mdash;not following the river exactly, but taking the
cut-off Mr. Grant marked for him. The air-line distance is about 13 m. Supposing
him to have taken something like the usual trail, he went as follows:
At 3 m. direct above Grand Rapids, 4 m. by the river, he passed Pokegama
falls at 1 p. m., Jan. 29th. This is a place where the Mississippi drops about
15 feet over a granular quartz ridge: Pike maps it "Falls of Pakagama 20 F<sup>t.</sup>
Portage 200 yards." It is naturally one of the best known points on the river in
this vicinity. It is visible in part from the car window as you go by on the railroad,
but the dam which has been built just above is a more conspicuous object
from that point of view. Nicollet calls the cataract Kabikons or Little falls,
and more fully Kakabikons or Little-severed Rock falls. At 3Â¼ m. by the
river, above these falls, is the discharge of Lake Pokegama itself. This is
by far the largest body of water in the vicinity, having an extreme length of
13 m.; but its form is so irregular, something like a hand with spread-out fingers,
that its actual shore-line is very much greater; and a number of smaller sheets
of water are dotted about it on all sides. Two of the largest of these are Sisibakwet
and Rice lakes. Nicollet renders Pakegomag, "a name applied by the
Chippeways to all sheets of water in the vicinity of a river," Rep. 1843, p. 63.
Schoolcraft says Peckagama, Allen Pecagama, Owen Pokegoma; Packegamau,
and I suppose a dozen more forms of the word, are found; Beltrami has Pakegamanaguen
or Hook l.; the form I use seems to be most frequent now. The
accent is on the antepenult&mdash;PokegÂ´-ama. A mile or so below the mouth of
this lake Bass brook falls in from the north, discharging from Bass and other
lakes; the town of Cohasset is at its mouth. The trail now crosses, or lately
did cross, the Mississippi from S. E. to N. W. in this vicinity. It continues
westward, past two overflows of the river known as Backwater and Cut-off lakes,
respectively, on one side and the other of the Mississippi, continues to a small
lake which I suppose to be one of those so said by Pike above, and then strikes
for the larger lake he speaks of. This traverse leaves the Mississippi several
miles to the left as you go west; for the river makes an extensive sharp bend S.,
and there receives Vermilion r. (Wanomon r. on Nicollet's map) from the S., at
the bight of this bend. Exactly 2Â¼ m. below the mouth of Vermilion r. is the
discharge of Lake Kabukasagetewa (as the name is rendered on the Warner and
Foote map). The "large lake" of the above text is evidently that known to the
voyageurs as Lac aux ChÃªnes, whence our Oak l., also White Oak l.; from the
head of which to Pointe aux ChÃªnes, now Oak pt. or White Oak pt. (Red-oak
Point, Nic., p. 63), is exactly 2Â½ m. This is clearly the place where the good
Samaritan Chippewa and his amiable family resided, close by the mouth of
Deer r., which Pike charts by this name, and which is still so called. This falls
in from the N. through another White Oak l., also called Deer, also Stephen's.
Notice that <i>this last</i> (Deer r.) is the stream Beltrami erroneously calls Onomonikana-sibi
or Vermilion r., as he fetches it in on the N., both in text and on his
map.</p>

<p class="footnote"><i>Addendum to the above.</i> I found when at Deer River that the nomenclature of
the natives does not agree with that on our best maps regarding the lake to be called
"White Oak." The first White Oak l. of the above note, and of all our modern
maps&mdash;the one which Pike comes to before he reaches White Oak pt.&mdash;is a
small one 1Â½ Ã Â¾ m., lying chiefly in Sects. 3 and 10 of T. 55, R. 27, 4th M.,
and through it goes one but not the other of the two courses into which the Mississippi
is here widely divided. The people never call this White Oak l., but
apply that name to the much larger one through which Deer r. discharges above
White Oak pt.&mdash;the Deer l. of Nicollet, Stephen's lake of our maps. This is a
pear-shaped body of water 2Â¾ m. in extreme length, with a greatest breadth of
over a mile at its lower end. It lies mainly in Sects. 1, 2, and 12 of T. 144,
R. 25, 5th M., but with the butt end overrunning into T. 56, R. 27, 4th M.,
and both the inlet and the outlet of Deer r. being in the latter township. It is
thus entirely off Pike's trail, N. and W. of White Oak pt. This lake discharges
into a loop of the Mississippi by a short thoroughfare of Â½ a mile, ending close
above White Oak pt., in the N. E. Â¼ of Sect. 13, T. 144, R. 25, 5th M. The
miserable hamlet of Deer River&mdash;as vile a place as it was ever my bad luck to
discover&mdash;lies W. of Deer r., and a mile or more N. of White Oak l. Here
is the terminus of the D. and W. R. R., a siding of which runs down to the lake
at a point Â½ a mile W. of the inlet of Deer r., where a pier is built. On crossing
the lake to get into and go up the Mississippi the usual route is through the
outlet and thence <i>down</i> the Mississippi for nearly a mile, to get into a long,
straight cut-off which avoids some great bends. But there is a shorter way still,
if one can find it, as I did on coming down&mdash;an obscure point directly opposite
the pier, in the reeds, where a canoe can be pushed through into the nearest
bend, and so save more than a mile. A fact which may have originated or perpetuated
the above noted confusion of names is that, above this <i>large</i> White Oak
or Stephen's l. there is a point of hard-wood called Little White Oak pt., occupying
a position with reference to the larger lake like that which the original
Pointe aux ChÃªnes or Oak pt. bears to the lesser lake. A glance at the Engineer
chart, or at such a good map as Jewett's, on the scale of 2 m. to the
inch, will give a clearer idea of these points than the most elaborate description
is likely to convey.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-55" id="Footnote_II-55" href="#FNanchor_II-55"><span class="label">[II-55]</span></a> "Chewockomen," as well as the "Chewockmen" of the 1807 ed., is far
from any recognized or acceptable spelling of the Chippewa word, one fairly
good form of which is <i>Kitchimokomen</i>. Schoolcraft has Chimoquemon. It
means Big Knives or Long Knives, and is commonly so translated, the reference
being either to the swords of the officers or the bayonets of the soldiers, which
have often struck Indians forcibly, both in a literal and in a figurative sense.
Kitchimokomen corresponds to the Sioux name <i>Isantanka</i>, of the same meaning
and application.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_II-56" id="Footnote_II-56" href="#FNanchor_II-56"><span class="label">[II-56]</span></a> On leaving White Oak pt. on the morning of Jan. 31st, Pike and
Miller proceeded approximately up the course of the Mississippi to the "fork"
above said, <i>i. e.</i>, the confluence of Leech Lake fork with the main stream.
This stretch, which Pike calls "nearly 15 miles long," is just 6 m. in an air-line,
and not much more by the trail. The Mississippi here flows through
"meadows," as Pike correctly says; these meadows are in part what Nicollet
named Eagle Nest savannah. It is absolutely flat and low marshy ground,
alternating with haying fields, extending widely on both sides of the river, S.
and W. of White Oak l. Little White Oak pt. reaches the river in a narrow
tongue of higher ground, from the N., while higher up several bends of the
river abut against woodland on the S. Throughout this reach the river is exceeding
tortuous; its bends are, moreover, so connected with collateral channels, in
part natural and in part artificial, that the stream is virtually double and incloses
a series of large islands in its sinuous folds. Some of these thoroughfares float
the steamboats that ply on the river to transport the hay; others are mere
ditches, through which only canoes can be shoved. Two m. below (N. N.
E. of) the Leech Lake fork, the Mississippi receives an important affluent,
namely, the discharge of Ball Club l., which enters at about the middle of the
S. border of Sect. 31, T. 145, R. 25, 5th M., and thus only about 4 m. due W.
of Deer River (town). The difference in level between this lake and the river
is so slight that sometimes, when the latter is full, it backs up into the former.
Ball Club is a pretty large lake&mdash;6 m. long, usually called 7, and 1 to 2 m. broad
in different places, with its long axis about N. W. and S. E.; its shape is not
very well delineated on the Engineer chart, being not elbowed enough. The
outlet is from the lower broad end, in the same Sect. in which it joins the
Mississippi, and is thus less than 1 m. long (little over Â½ m.). This lake is
notable because it is the usual and direct route up to Little Lake Winnibigoshish
and so on, to avoid the more circuitous course of the Mississippi itself. You
traverse the main axis of the lake from its outlet N. W. to its head, and there
make a portage of a mile or so over into Little Lake Winnibigoshish. "Ball
Club," the now universal name of this body of water, is a term which translates
the F. La Crosse; Schoolcraft renders once Lac a la Crose; Pike has Lac Le
Crosse and Le Cross. Schoolcraft has in another place Bogottowa l., which
aboriginal name is rendered Bagatwa by Beltrami, Pagadowan by Nicollet, by
others Pagadawin, etc. All these names refer to the celebrated game of ball,
which the learned Anglojibway Warren calls <i>baugahudoway</i>. Several streams
feed this lake; one of them comes in at the head, from a small lake which
Schoolcraft named Helix l., from the abundance of its snails of that genus.
To return from this excursus to Pike at the mouth of the Leech Lake fork, up
which he goes: This is of course a definite and well-known point, exactly on
the dividing line between the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 7, T. 144, R. 25, and the S. E.
Â¼ of Sect. 12, T. 144, R. 26, 5th M. I had a good view of the confluence
from a bit of high bank on the left or N. side of the Mississippi, looking
across the mazes of marsh and meadow land through which both streams meander
to their junction. Leech Lake r. is a very large branch of the Mississippi,
deserving the name of "fork" which Pike applies; he also calls it the
South, and the Sang Sue branch or fork. Beltrami essays the Chippewa name,
as Cazaguaguagine-sibi. Inasmuch as Pike considered this river to be the
main stream, I propose to designate Leech Lake and its feeders and discharge
as the <b>Pikean Source</b>, in distinction from the Julian, Plantagenian, and
Itascan sources we shall discuss beyond. Passing the Forks, Pike and Miller
go up Leech Lake r., Jan. 31st, to some undetermined point in the vicinity of
the largest lake into which this stream expands, and which Pike calls Muddy l.
This is of an oval figure, about 4 m. long by half as broad; its outlet is 3Â¼ m.
up Leech Lake r. from the forks. Nicollet named it Lake Bessel, after the
famous scientist&mdash;his map fairly glitters with the galaxy of illustrious names he
reflects from the bosoms of lakes in Northern Minnesota, though I cannot
recall an instance in which such academic nomenclature has been "understanded
of the people" and retained in their speech. The lake in present
mention is always called Mud or Muddy, and is much frequented by the
Indians for the eminently utilitarian purpose of gathering wild rice. I saw a
string of their canoes heading that way Aug. 15th, 1894.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-1" id="Footnote_III-1" href="#FNanchor_III-1"><span class="label">[III-1]</span></a> It is simple justice to Pike to state here that, in making this widely erroneous
statement, he reflected common report of his day, and that he elsewhere
himself qualifies the assertion. Thus, in his general review of the Mississippi
(which in the orig. ed. formed Doc. No. 18, p. 41 <i>seq.</i> of the App. to Part 1),
he says of the Leech Lake branch: "This is rather considered as the main
source, although the Winipeque [read Winnibigoshish] branch is navigable the
greatest distance." If the volume of waters collected by Leech l. and then contributed
to the Mississippi were made the criterion, the true Itascan source might
have to look to its laurels. Deferring other considerations to a more convenient
connection, we may here confine attention to the Leech Lake system. The
lake itself is much the largest body of water in the Mississippi basin above Mille
Lacs, much exceeding in size Lake Winnibigoshish, which itself much exceeds
Lake Cass. These three are the largest reservoirs of the whole drainage area
whose waters unite at the junction of the Leech Lake branch with the main
stream. This area, taken down to Pokegama falls, is about 80 m. from E.
to W. and 50 from N. to S.; its content is more than a thousand lakes and
rivers, few of which have been named. These are quite clearly divided into
two main sets, namely, those of the Leech Lake system on the one hand, and
all the rest on the other. Leech l. is not much smaller than Red l. (of a different
system); its greatest diameter in one direction is over 20 m.; its figure is
extremely irregular, giving a shore-line said to be of about 160 m. length, with
9 principal salient re-entrances and 6 large bays; the feeders, large and small,
are 25-30 in number. The "fond du lac" is at that S. W. place where the
waters of Kabekona and other lakes discharge by the Kabekona r., in Sect. 9,
T. 142, R. 31, 5th M. This series affords, with several portages, a tolerably
direct approach to Lake Itasca, which lies at an air-line distance of about 25 m.
nearly due W. North of the mouth of the Kabekona, in Sect. 9, T. 143, of
the same R. and M., the Kapukasagitowa, Pikesagidowag, or Bukesagidowag r.
falls in from the N. W. This point is only 7 m. directly S. of the southernmost
part of Cass l., and a chain of 10 small lakes here lies between Cass and
Leech, offering a waterway with some portages. Two of these small lakes are
Moss and Shiba of Schoolcraft; two others of them are his Kapuka Sagitowa
lakes. Further E. on the N. shore of Leech l. a river falls in from the N.
in Sect. 14, T. 144, R. 30. This is Carp r. of Schoolcraft, draining from a
chain of small lakes which approach the Mississippi itself in that portion of its
course which runs from Cass to Winnibigoshish l. The N. E. extremity of
Leech l., called Rush l. by Schoolcraft and Pickering bay by Nicollet, reaches
within 4 m. (air-line) of Lake Winnibigoshish; there is a small lake between,
named Lake Duponceau by Nicollet, but now known as Portage l., from the
function indicated by this name. In fact it is easier to go from Winnibigoshish
over into Leech than from Cass over into the same. Along the S. W., S., S. E.,
and E. shores of Leech l. is a succession of affluents, some of the larger of
which respectively establish waterways of communication with Crow Wing r.,
with Pine r., and with Willow r. The largest of these Leech l. tributaries is
Kwiwisens or Boy r., which offers by its system of lakes and portages the most
direct route by way of Willow r. to Sandy l. Some of the lakes along this line
are by Nicollet named Hassler, Gauss, Deluot, Eccleston, BrÃ»lÃ©, and Rosati.
One of the communications with Pine r. is made by Sandy r., which falls into
Leech l. from the S. (The Crow Wing connections are noticed elsewhere in
detail.) Leech l. discharges by Leech Lake r. near its N. E. extremity, the
outlet being in Sect. 29, T. 144, R. 28, 5th M. The discharge is now controlled
by a dam which, like the similar structures at the outlet of Lake Winnibigoshish
and elsewhere, is designed to utilize the lakes as artificial reservoirs
to regulate the flow of the Mississippi according to the requirements for navigation.
Leech Lake r. is bowed into an arc whose chord is 16 m. long; Mud l.
lies in its course, as already said. The principal projection of land into Leech
l. from the N. is the well-known Otter-tail pt.; opposite this, from the south,
is Big pt.; continuous with which, by a narrow isthmus, is a very extensive
peninsula of remarkable form, something like a badly shaped anchor or a distorted
letter T. This Tau-formed peninsula is the best known and most historic
place about the lake, as the site of a Chippewa village and various other establishments,
of which more anon. There are several islands in Leech l.; the
largest is Bear or Mukwa isl. (Macuwa of Beltrami); two others are Pelican and
Goose. Leech l. derives its English name from the F. Lac Sang Sue, or L. aux
Sangsues, originally bestowed in compliment to the sanguisugent annelids with
which it was supposed to be peculiarly favored, by the Chippewas, who conveyed
their meaning in the voluble vocable Kasagaskwadjimekang.</p>

1787, etc. Constantin FranÃ§ois Chasseb&oelig;uf, Comte de Volney, b. Craon,
Anjou, Feb. 3d, 1757, d. Paris, Apr. 25th, 1820, is best known in letters by his
celebrated work, commonly called "Volney's Ruins," <i>i. e.</i>, Les Ruines ou
MÃ©ditations sur les RÃ©volutions des Empires, etc., orig. ed. 1791, numberless
trans. and eds. down to the present time. The illustrious author was the peer
of Voltaire or Paine in philosophy and religion, and underwent the usual vicissitudes
of free-thinkers of his time, from the prison to the peerage. His intellect
was clear and profound, his erudition vast and varied; so they called him
an "infidel"&mdash;whatever they may have meant by that&mdash;and having given him
the name would have hanged him had he been hangable. His researches were
chiefly in the fields of history, geography, archÃ¦ology, linguistics, statecraft,
and priestcraft, all of which he illuminated to the great inconvenience of political
and ecclesiastical demagogues. <i>Nullum tetigit quod non ornavit</i>; the clergy,
however, he adorned with a touch that Voltaire himself might have envied.
Count Volney was in the U.Â S. in 1795-6-7; his controversy with the meritorious
but somewhat obtuse Priestley, on the unquestionable unorthodoxy of
his Ruins, brought his more formal scientific works into prominence, and
accentuated the fame of his most imperishable treatise. Cheap editions of
the Ruins abound, usually including the tract originally entitled La Loi
Naturelle; this is a little catechism designed by a great philosopher to kindly
help little fools out of some of their folly; it is quite worthy to rank with
Paine's Age of Reason. Volney's complete works were edited by A. Bossange,
8 vols., Paris, 1820-26. Pike was in good company on the 3d, while he nursed
his sore feet.</p>

after Pike first left them on the 26th of Jan., unless one is conveyed in the statement
that Miller <i>returned</i> with a supply of provisions for them. That would
seem to imply that they followed Pike's trail, and came to Leech l. by a route
the same as his, or one not materially different. This is in fact what they did:
see <a href="#Footnote_II-51">note<sup>51</sup></a>, p. 142. The shorter way would have been that Willow River
traverse indicated in <a href="#Footnote_III-1">note<sup>1</sup></a>, p. 153. What seems to have been a usual
route in former days is clearly indicated on Nicollet's map. Starting from
Sandy l. it struck W. to Willow r. and went up this to Rosati and BrulÃ© lakes,
whence by portage over to Eccleston or Deluot l., and so to the Boy's River
connection, continued through Gauss and Hassler lakes. All these have different
names now, and I cannot speak with confidence in the new nomenclature.
Among the lakes of Nicollet's series appear to be those now called Big Rice,
Thunder, and Boy.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-6" id="Footnote_III-6" href="#FNanchor_III-6"><span class="label">[III-6]</span></a> This is the first intimation we have that Pike is not already at the west end,
or at any rate on the west side of Leech l. He certainly has told us that he
"crossed the lake 12 miles" to reach Mr. M'Gillis' house, where he is now
quartered. The only place marked on Pike's map is on the W. side, with the
legend "N. W. C<sup>o</sup>. Ho. Lat. 47Â° 16Â´ 18Â´Â´ N." The position of this seems to
have been near Sugar pt., and to be the same as that marked "Old N. W.
House" on Lt. James Allen's map facing p. 76 of Schoolcraft's Rep. pub. 1834.
There have been various trading-houses at the same and different points about
Leech l., simultaneously and successively. In 1832, according to Schoolcraft's
large map in the work just said, there was a "Tr. Post" on the E. side of the
lake, between the outlet and Boy's r., but the principal one was on the Tau-formed
peninsula, and was a post of the Am. Fur Co. Schoolcraft was camped
there July 16th, 1832. This place was then also the site of the Chippewa village
of Gueule Platte or Flat Mouth, a chieftain of whom Pike has something to say
soon, and of whom Nicollet, who met him there in 1836, has told us somewhat,
Rep. 1843, p. 61 <i>seq.</i></p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-7" id="Footnote_III-7" href="#FNanchor_III-7"><span class="label">[III-7]</span></a> The Sweet of the above paragraph is elsewhere named by Pike as Wiscoup
and Le Sucre, first chief of a Red Lake band of Chippewas; The Burnt,
as Oole and La Brule, for which latter phrase I suppose Le BrÃ»lÃ© might be preferred
by some fastidious persons. The Buck is Iaba Waddik of Schoolcraft,
Summary, etc., 1855, p. 144. The Sweet was probably not so named from any
such personal peculiarity as would have singled him out among all Indians of whatever
tribe, but with reference in some way to the concrete juice of the sugar-maple,
<i>Acer saccharinum</i>, upon which he fed: <i>cf.</i> Sugar pt., a place-name in this vicinity.
This is evidently the poetical case of "sweets to The Sweet"&mdash;not of <i>saccharum
per se</i>. The scholarly Anglojibway, Hon. W. W. Warren, who should know
best how to spell Chippewa words of any author I have read, gives the name as
Weeshcoob. This chief had great character, and a long career. For some of
his exploits which became historical, see Minn. Hist. Coll., V. 1885, pp. 231,
376, 452, 454, 458&mdash;latter with esp. ref. to Pike.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-8" id="Footnote_III-8" href="#FNanchor_III-8"><span class="label">[III-8]</span></a> Haut Lac aux CÃ¨dres Rouges of the French, Upper Red Cedar l. of the
English, in distinction from the one of like name much further down the Mississippi,
near Aitkin: see <a href="#Footnote_II-47">note<sup>47</sup></a>, p. 135. Pike is careless about the names, and
calls both lakes Red Cedar, or Cedar without further qualification. The valuable
species of <i>Juniperus</i>, commonly known as "cedar" or "red cedar," is not
a very abundant tree in N. Minnesota, and its prevalence about each of these
lakes duplicated their designation. They are too far apart, luckily, for any
confusion to have ever arisen. Pike's description of Up. R. C. l. is not good,
and his map is so far out as to omit entirely the entrance of the Mississippi into
this lake; for what he delineates as and mistook for the entrance of the main
river is merely the discharge of the Turtle River chain of lakes from the Beltramian
or so-called Julian source of the Mississippi, which falls in at the extreme
N. border of the lake. Thus, what the text means by saying "from the entrance
of the Mississippi to the streight is called six miles," is the distance from the
mouth of Turtle r. to the strait which divides off Pike's bay from the rest of
Cass l.; "thence to the south end," etc., is the length of Pike's bay; the
"bay at the entrance" of the supposed Mississippi, <i>i. e.</i>, of Turtle r., means
the general recess of Cass l. on the N.; and finally, the "large point," given as
2Â½ m. "from the north side," is the point of Colcaspi or Grand isl., which is
almost a peninsula, and which marks off Allen's bay from the rest of Cass l.
With this much by way of comment on Pike, we will look further at this interesting
body of water, which I have lately crossed twice. Its first English
name, after the ones above given, was Lake Cassina, bestowed by Schoolcraft
in 1820, in honor of Governor and General Lewis Cass (b. Exeter, N. H.,
Oct. 9th, 1782, d. Detroit, Mich., June 17th, 1866), leader of the expedition
which made its nearest approach to the true source of the Miss. r., in July of
that year. Their camp was on the N. shore, close by the mouth of Turtle r.,
on the W. side of that mouth, directly opposite the site of the N. W. Co. Ho.
where Pike now is. The name "Cassina Lake" stands on the Schlcr. map of
the 1820 Cass exped.; item, "Cassina L." is on Long's map, 1823; the adj.
Cassinian also occurs in Schlcr. and elsewhere; but the latter afterward clipped
the name to Cass, and it has become fixed in this form&mdash;the same as that of the
county later dedicated appropriately to this eminent statesman and soldier. The
Schlcr. map of 1820 also lays down the Turtle River system with approximate
accuracy, and on this map was first traced the course of the Mississippi to Lake
Itasca. This had not then received its present name, but stands there as
"L. Labeish," <i>i. e.</i>, Lac La Biche, or Lac Ã  la Biche, translating the Chippewa
Omoshkos Sogiagon, and translated Elk l. in English. The main defect
of the 1820 map was in laying down the Itascan source to the N. W. instead
of to the S. W. of Cass l.&mdash;thus really on the line of the Turtle River source.
This mistake was corrected in 1832, the year that Schoolcraft's party were
guided to Lake Itasca itself by the Chippewa chief, Ozawindib or Yellow Head.
Schoolcraft's nomenclature, as far as possible, was accepted by the greatest
geographer who ever saw the source of the Mississippi, and Nicollet's example
in this respect has been generally followed. Cass is a beautiful lake, the third
largest in the drainage-area of the uppermost Mississippi, being exceeded in
size only by Winnibigoshish and Leech. The greatest length is nearly meridional;
including Pike's bay it is 9Â¾ m.; the greatest breadth is almost due E.
and W.; including Allen's bay it is 7Â½ m. In position with reference to the
5th meridian (the only one with which we have to do in this note), the Range line
of townships 30-31, and the Township line of 145-146, decussate at right angles
in the center of the lake, just off the E. shore of Colcaspi isl. The body of water
thus occupies portions of four townships. In figure Cass l. is more irregular
than Lake Winnibigoshish, less so than Leech l. Pike's bay, on the S., is
almost shut off from the rest of the lake by a long, narrow peninsula which
stretches nearly across from E. to W., leaving but a very narrow thoroughfare.
Pike's bay is of rounded form, about 3 m. in any diameter. Allen's bay, on
the W., is almost equally well marked off by Colcaspi isl.; it is 2&#8531; m. long,
with an average width of over a mile, and includes two small islands, named Elm
and Garden. Red Cedar isl. lies in the S. E. part of the main body of water;
but the most conspicuous feature of the lake is the island best known as Grand
or Colcaspi. The latter curious name is one of those verbal wind-eggs which
Schoolcraft was fond of hatching; he tells us it is compounded of fragments of
the names of "the three prior explorers," meaning Cass and himself, 1820, and
Pike, 1806. This Island of Ozawindib, as named by Brower, 1894, is shaped
like a blacksmith's anvil or molar tooth; its greatest diameters, along conjugate
diagonal axes, are 2Â¾ and 2Â½ m.; aside from its horns, the island would yield
a square of about 1Â¼ m. The Chippewa village of Ozawindib, where Schoolcraft
was camped July 10th and again July 15th&mdash;between which dates he went to
Itasca and back&mdash;was on the N. E. point of the anvil. I should advise canoeists
to give this point a wide berth; for a shoal runs far out northward, and the
birch-bark may thump on a stony bottom if there is any sea. This shoal
reaches out directly across the straightest traverse from the inlet to the outlet of
the Mississippi. Ozawindib isl. is almost a peninsula in relation to the north
shore of the lake, but a canoe can generally be floated across the isthmus. I waded
and dragged my boat on going up, but on returning was obliged to make a
portage of a few paces, as the water had lowered. But even if it be found
a carrying-place, it is the shortest and best way across the lake from the inlet
of the Mississippi, either to its outlet or to the inlet of Turtle r. The latter
falls in at the extreme N. of the lake, 2Â½ m. W. N. W. from the outlet of the
Mississippi, in the N. E. Â¼ of Sect. 18, T. 146, R. 30. Here came David
Thompson in 1798, along the usual traders' route from the Red River country,
in part the then supposed course of the Mississippi itself above Red Cedar l.
Here, in Roy's N. W. Co. House, on the E. or left bank, is Pike this 12th of
February, 1806. Here were Cass and Schoolcraft in 1820; here came Beltrami
in 1823, down this same Turtle r. from his Lake Julia, and so from the Julian
source of the Mississippi. A mission once stood here; there is now an Indian
village at a little distance westward. The place may be recognized at a distance
by a high ridge on the right or W. bank; and on nearer approach by a stout
post with historical inscriptions, erected by Brower in August, 1894. About
a mile up Turtle r. expands into a lake, called Kichi by Nicollet in 1836,
and by error Kitihi, as on Brower's map of 1892. No other considerable
stream enters Cass l., excepting the Mississippi itself. The Mississippi
leaves the lake in a recess on the N. E. shore, easy to find by good land-marks&mdash;notice
a clump of trees on the right of the outlet as you approach it, and
a house on the first rising ground to the left. The position is in the N. E. Â¼
of Sect. 21, T. 146, R. 30. From this point the river flows nearly E. S. E. into
Lake Winnibigoshish (makes 2&#8532; m. of southing in 8Â¼ m. of easting&mdash;air-line
about 9 m.). The general course is about straight, but the reciprocal bends are
numerous, giving an actual course, as I should judge, of 16Â¾ m., though they
call it 18. This is Cass r. or Red Cedar r.&mdash;the most beautiful part of the
Mississippi&mdash;good flat water and plenty of it at the lowest stages of canoeing,
with a moderate current and no rapids, shoals, or snags to speak of; also, good
camping places all along on the wooded points or knolls. The only tributary of
this "interlaken" course of the Mississippi is from the S., about halfway between
Cass and Winnibigoshish; being the discharge from Horn l. (Eshkabwaka l.
of Owen), Â¾ of a mile (direct) E. of the boundary between Itasca and Beltrami
cos., in the S. E. Â¼ of Sect. 30, T. 146, R. 29.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike at Leech l. was the nearest he ever went to the true source of the Mississippi&mdash;about
25 m. in an air-line E. of Lake Itasca. Pike at Cass l. is further
away from this goal, but he is on the course of the great river. Having already
noted the Leech Lake sub-basin, or what I call the Pikean source, I will with
the reader's indulgence indicate the main features of the true Itascan or Nicolletian
sub-basin. To this end we will start together from Cass l. and paddle
our own canoe to Lake Itasca. The following observations are from my canoe
voyage from Deer River to Lake Itasca and return, Aug. 15th-Sept. 3d, 1894:</p>

<p class="footnote">The Mississippi enters Cass l. at the W. end of Allen's bay, by a crooked <b>s</b>-shaped
thoroughfare about a mile long, from the next lake above. The inlet
into Cass opens in the center of Sect. 29, T. 146, R. 31; the outlet from the
other lake is in the N. W. Â¼ of the same section. So close, in fact, are the
two lakes, that at two places they are only separated by 100 yards or less. At
the northern one of these short portages stands a dilapidated old chapel, once a
mission-house, and other buildings are scattered about, chiefly Chippewa cabins.
I could learn no name for this next lake, though it appears to be the one Schoolcraft
called Andrusia in 1855; but if so, the name has lapsed. A letter before
me from Hon. J. V. Brower, Itasca State Park Commissioner, dated St. Paul,
Sept. 15th, 1894, says: "The beautiful body of water situated upon Sects. 7, 8,
17, 18, 19, 20, 29, and 30, T. 146, R. 31, 5th M., above Cass lake, and through
which the Mississippi takes its course, has this day been named by me Lake
Elliott Coues, as a slight recognition of your services to the public, and for the
purposes of a more accurate and correct geographical description." This lake
is 3Â½ m. long by 1Â¼ m. in greatest breadth, with its long axis meridional.
The Mississippi runs across its S. end about Â¾ of a mile from W. to E., the
inlet being in the N. W. Â¼ of Sect. 30 of the same T. and R. as the outlet.
A trader's house is on the N. side, in a Chippewa village. A winding course of
the Mississippi of 2 m. brings us to another lake, Pamitascodiac or Tascodiac of
Schoolcraft, and Vandermaelen of Nicollet. This is hourglass-shaped, 2Â¼ m.
long by about a mile across either bulb. The Mississippi enters it at the N.
and leaves it at the E., the inlet and outlet being within half a mile of each
other, in Sect. 25, T. 146, R. 32. For 2 or 3 m. above Lake Tascodiac canoeing
is easy, through the flat water of marsh and meadow land; but then begins
the trouble which hardly intermits thence to Lake Bemidji. The canoeist may
as well put on his rubber boots at the start and keep them on, for he will have
to wade most of the way and drag or shove his boat through almost incessant
rocky rapids, shoals, and snags. My canoe drew only about 3 inches of water when
my man and myself were overboard, yet we had great difficulty in getting along
at all without portaging. Where the water is flat, it is shoal and snaggy; otherwise
it is all "Metoswa" rapids. The distance from Lake Tascodiac to Lake
Bemidji is only 8 m. in an air line, but this is the chord of a considerable arc
the river describes northward, which, with the minor bends around the wooded
points, makes, as I judge, about 13Â½ m. of water-course. The people call it
20 m., but that is because it is such a hard road to travel. It took me a day
and a quarter to make Bemidji from Elliott Coues; but I did the same distance
in less than one day coming down. Beltrami calls this course "Demizimagua-maguen-sibi,
or River of Lake Traverse," II. p. 434&mdash;which reminds me to say
that among the Indians each section of the river between lakes takes the name of
the lake whence it flows. The Bemidji section of the Mississippi issues from the
lake of that name in the N. W. Â¼ of Sect. 2, T. 146, R. 33, near the middle
of the E. shore. This outlet is hidden in a maze of bulrushes, and as there is no
conspicuous landmark on shore it is not easy to find. Lake Bemidji is a large
body of water 5Â½ m. long N. and S., by 1Â¾ to 2Â½ m. broad, of somewhat
pyriform figure, lying athwart the course of the Mississippi: whence the F. name
Lac Traverse, which we render Traverse, Travers, and Cross lake; Schl.
named it Queen Anne's l. in 1855. Among the Indian forms are Pamitchi,
as Schoolcraft; Pemidji, as Nicollet; also Bermiji, Permidji, etc., and with
an additional element Bemejigemug, Pamajiggermug, etc. The N. end
of Bemidji is only 2Â½ m. from the S. end of Turtle l., so that the Julian
sources may be here easily reached by portage. From the outlet as above
described to the inlet is 2Â¾ m. on a S. W. course; for the Mississippi enters at
the extreme S. W. angle, in the N. W. Â¼ of Sect. 16, T. 146, R. 33. Here are
some Chippewa cabins, and here is also the lair of one of the ferocious blood-sucking
parasites of the tribe of Indian traders. The system only differs from
robbery in name. For instance, the squaw-man will sell you a whitefish for 10
cents a pound. He bought that fish for two cents a pound from the Indian who
caught it, and he also paid for it in goods at his own price, probably about five
times their cost to him. Those old traders who were satisfied to make 250 per
cent. on prime cost were meek and lowly philanthropists in comparison with
some of their successors. A short wide thoroughfare of about 40 rods leads
directly from Bemidji into Lake Irving, so named by Schoolcraft in 1832 after
the facile writer, and still so called. This is only 1Â½ m. broad by Â¾ long,
lying chiefly in Sects. 16 and 17; the Mississippi comes directly across its short
axis from S. to N. The inlet is at the S. E. corner of Sect. 17. On Nicollet's
published map "L. Irving" appears out of place altogether, on another stream.
But that is a mere accident of cartography, for which the admirable geographer
is not responsible; he knew where Lake Irving is as well as I do. Three short
bends and then a straight course of a mile bring us up the Mississippi to the
mouth of a river from the S., to be particularly noted for several reasons. It is
the largest remaining tributary of the Mississippi, and one of its sources is a lake
no more than 5 m. from Itasca itself. This river joins the Mississippi in the
S. E. of Sect. 20, T. 146, R. 33. Going up it we at once fall upon the very
small Lake Marquette; next, Lake La Salle (Lasale on Nicollet's map), larger
and hourglass-shaped; next, Lake Plantagenet, a two-legged body of water,
2Â¾ m. long by 1Â¾ broad. The first two were named in 1832 by Schoolcraft,
who also said the largest one was called Kubba Kunna, or Rest in the Path l.&mdash;these
terms becoming Rahbahkanna and Resting l. in Allen. Continuing through
Lake Plantagenet and up this "Plantagenian source" of the Mississippi, as it
has come to be known, we find that it forks in Sect. 21, T. 144, R. 34, at a
direct distance of 7 or 8 m. from Lake Plantagenet. The fork on our left as we
go up takes us 5 or 6 m. further to Lake Naiwa, called Neway l. by Nicollet,
and recently renamed Lake George. Alongside and emptying into this is
Nicollet's L. Bowditch, lately renamed L. Paine. These two are in Sects. 15, 19,
22, and 21, T. 143, R. 34. Going up the other fork, we find in about 3 m.
that it forks. The fork on our left as we go up comes N. from a number of
small lakes, one of them lately become known as Lake Chenowagesic; and this
is probably to be considered the main course of the river we are now on. The
other fork comes from the west; if we follow it up we proceed directly toward
Lake Itasca, and find our stream heading in a lake which occupies portions of
Sects. 2 and 11, T. 143, R. 35. This is Lake Assawa&mdash;Ossowa and Usawa of
Schoolcraft, Usaw-way or Perch of Allen, Assawe of Nicollet; also, Lake Alice
of the Rand-McNally map (Chicago, 1894), whose compilers adopted the
names bestowed by a certain unfortunate excursionist. Another name this
unhappy person gave this same lake is Elvira. It is historically of the greatest
possible interest, for from Lake Assawa did Schoolcraft's party proceed by portage
to discover Lake Itasca in 1832, and from it also did Nicollet proceed by
portage to Lake Itasca in 1836, and so on to discover the actual source of the
Mississippi, which Schoolcraft missed in his hurry on that happy-go-lucky 13th
of July. As to the name which the whole stream thus sketched should bear,
there may be two opinions. Schoolcraft maps it with the legend "Plantagenian
or South Fork of the Mississippi," and makes the Assawa Lake fork the main
source, calling the Naiwa Lake fork by the name of this lake. Nicollet names
the main stream R. Laplace, after the celebrated astronomer, as he did L.
Bowditch after the translator of that author's MÃ©canique CÃ©leste; and he considers
the main stream to be that middle one which comes from the Chenowagesic
l., furthest from the S. (over the border of Hubbard Co., in fact). This
view is undoubtedly correct, and I, for one, should like to see Nicollet's designation
of Laplace r. stand. But the river is in fact called the Naiwa, and this
current designation will probably prevail. I observe that our best maps in the
present uncertainty omit any name, though the Rand-McNally map legends
"Schoolcraft R." (after Eastman's, 1855). Should the main stream come to be
known to geographers as the Naiwa, I would suggest that its E. fork be called
the East Naiwa, agreeably with Schoolcraft's, 1832; and the other the West Naiwa.</p>

<p class="footnote">We return from this excursion up the Naiwa or Laplace r.&mdash;the Plantagenian
source of the Mississippi&mdash;and proceed up the latter from the mouth of the
former. We hold a due W. course on the whole for 5Â½ m. in an air-line, but
on a zigzag with multitudinous minor tortuosities, making the distance more
than twice as far; part of the way winding among wooded points, working our
way over shoals and among snags, to a point in the N. W. Â¼ of Sect. 28, T. 146,
R. 34. Here the small Allenoga r., on our right from the north, discharges from
a small, crooked lake which lies mainly in Sects. 16 and 21. Knowing no name
for this, I call it Cowhorn l., from its shape and from the trivial circumstance of
finding a horn stuck on a stake in the river. We go on through a monotonous,
swampy tract of reeds, rushes, wild rice, and lily-pads, alternately approaching
and receding from tamarac clumps as the river winds about, for 2Â½ m. further
W. in an air-line, and more than three times that distance in actual paddling, till
we reach some haying-meadows, and soon find the entrance of a notable stream
on our right, in the N. E. Â¼ of Sect. 25, T. 146, R. 35; this is Pinidiwin r.
(Pinnidiwin, Carnage, and De Soto r. of Schoolcraft, Piniddiwin of Brower),
through a lake about a mile wide, filled with a fine crop of wild rice.
Hence it is one of many lakes which are called La Folle, Rice, or Manomin
(Monomina on the Rand-McNally map); but it had better keep the distinctive
name of the river which flows through it. I paddled up into Pinidiwin l., and
was surprised at the volume of water it discharged, as well as at the strength
of its current. But the river is a large, forked stream which drains a very extensive
area N. of the Mississippi. The volume of the Mississippi seemed diminished
nearly one-half above the mouth of this "Little Mississippi." The course
up the Mississippi is now S. W. to a point in the S. E. Â¼ of Sect. 35, T. 146, R.
35; where, at a bend, it receives a sizable tributary from the S. Nicollet charts
this stream, but has no name for it, and I know of none, excepting that suspicious
"Hennepin R." which appears on the same Rand-McNally map, so thoroughly
vitiated by countenancing the names given by a dishonest person. Hennepin r.
rises as far south as about the middle of T. 144, R. 35, and flows nearly due
northward; one of its tributaries comes from a certain Lake Joliet, the name of
which arose with the same trickster. Rounding the bend here we go up N. W.
into the middle of Sect. 28, T. 146, R. 35, and turn S. W. to the corner of this
section, on the property of Mr. A. J. Jones, a <i>bona fide</i> settler and cultivator of the
soil. The situation is also marked by a small creek (say Jones') which falls in
hard by from the W.; but it is more notable as a sort of "Great Bend" of the
Mississippi; for here is the place where, our course thus far having been on the
whole westward, we turn quite abruptly southward to make for Lake Itasca,
distant about 14 m. as the crow flies, but at least twice as far as that by the way
we paddle. It has been good flat water, with no obstructions to speak of, for
many miles back; but a little distance above Jones' place we come to rocky
rapids for half a mile, reminding us of our experiences below Lake Bemidji. I
do not think that these, but that some of those higher up, are the rapids where
Allen's boat was wrecked on the 15th of July, 1832, though Schoolcraft
talks of having come "32" m. from Itasca on the 14th, before the accident.
As we proceed, other obstacles offer; snags abound, the Mississippi becomes in
places too shallow to float a canoe, and in others bushes begin to meet across
the channel, or fallen logs require to be chopped out of the way. We pass an
insignificant creek on the right, and then soon sight quite an imposing pine-clad
ridge on the left. Here, in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 19, T. 145, R. 35, is the
mouth of a creek on the left. This is marked on Schoolcraft's map "Cano R.",
<i>i. e.</i>, Canot or Canoe r., also Ocano (Au Canot), and Chemaun r. It is charted
by Nicollet, without any name. It has been described by Brower as Andrus cr.,
is on Eastman's map (1855) as De Witt Clinton's r., and was once named La
Salle r. by an unscrupulous person. Above Andrus cr., in the S. E. Â¼ of Sect.
26 of the tp. last said, a small creek comes in on the right, at "Dutch Fred's"
place. I heard a man call it Bear cr. Here the Mississippi enters (or rather
leaves) a haying-meadow, and within a mile receives a small creek on our left,
from the S., locally known as Killpecker or Chillpecker cr. It is less than a
mile hence to the house of one Searles, in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 35, T. 145, R.
35. There is still visible evidence that this was the site of an old trading-post;
and on discussing the case with my friend Brower, I agreed with his conclusion
that it was most probably the very spot we hear of from William Morrison, who
was the first known of white men at Lake Itasca, in 1804. From this place upward
to Lake Itasca the Mississippi is practically unnavigable, at least in such a
low stage of water as that I found&mdash;not so much on account of the extensive
rapids as from snags and brush. The distance is called 20 m.&mdash;even 25 m., if
one wants you to hire his wagon&mdash;but it is nothing of the sort; 12 m. would
cover it. The air-line from Searles' house to Itasca is just 6 m., and though
the river is tortuous, besides having a general westward curve, it can hardly
be more than twice as much. One creek on this course, called Division cr.
by Brower, falls in from the W. in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 27, T. 144, R. 36.
A wagon-road leads from Searles' due S. to the lower end of the N. arm of
Lake Itasca. The distance is about 7 m. by this road, which keeps on the ridge
E. of the Mississippi till it ends at the lake, close by the outlet, in the S. W. Â¼
of Sect. 35, T. 144, R. 36, thus almost on the line between T. 144 and T.
143, which cuts the end of the N. arm, and forms the N. boundary of Itasca
State Park. Here Brower discovered the site of a prehistoric village in
Oct., 1894.</p>

<p class="footnote">This park, created by Act of the Minnesota Legislature, approved Apr.
20th, 1891, is 7 m. N. and S. by 5 m. E. and W., thus being 35 square miles,
19,701&#8532; acres, consisting of Sects. 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 34, 35, 36, of T. 143, R. 36, in
Beltrami Co., with Sects. 1, 2, 3, 4, of T. 142, R. 36, in Becker Co.,
Sects. 6, 7, 18, 19, 30, 31, of T. 143, R. 35, and Sect. 6, of T. 142, R. 35&mdash;these
in Hubbard Co. The rectangle thus delimited includes nearly all the
natural features about to be noted, in the area designated as the ultimate reservoir
bowl of the Mississippi by Brower, to whose admirable official report I am
indebted for some particulars which did not come under my personal observation
on the spot, Aug. 24th and 25th, 1894. The brim of the bowl is the Height of
Land, Nicollet's Hauteurs des Terres, <i>sc.</i> between Hudsonian and Mexican
waters; for all the water in the bowl runs into the Mississippi. The political
boundary of the park is less than conterminous with the area of this bowl. The
latter is conveniently divided into the greater and lesser segments, according
to whether the waters drain into the W. or the E. arm of Lake Itasca; the
greater segment contains the primal sources of the Mississippi. The brim of
the bowl has a maximum elevation of 1,750 feet above sea-level. The southernmost
lake in the bowl is Brower's Hernando de Soto, supposed to be 2,555Â¼ m.
from the Gulf of Mexico, at an altitude of 1,558 feet. Another is Morrison l.
There are too many other small lakes to mention, mostly beyond or beside
any actual permanent surface connection with the Mississippian stream; two
little ones which come very near to such connection are Whipple and Floating
Moss. The Mississippi springs from the ground under a hill which I call the
Verumontanum; the first collection of living waters, or what may be termed
Fons et Origo Springs, occurs about the contiguous corners of Sects. 28/33|27/34, T. 143,
R. 36. The rill which issues thence runs northward in Sects. 27 and 28, collecting
there in a pool worthily named by Brower the Upper Nicollet l., after the keen-eyed
geographer who first spied and mapped it in connection with his immortal
discovery of the Mississippian Verum Caput. But this Lacus Superior Nicolleti
is not now connected by surface flowage with the continuation of the Mississippi;
Brower is correct in designating its feeder as the "detached upper fork" of the
Mississippi; for the Upper Nicollet l. is separated by a dry ridge a few yards
wide, forming a sort of "natural bridge," under or through which water seeps,
but over which it certainly never flows. Stepping a few paces over this Pons
Naturalis, we descend into a boggy place where the several Nicollet Springs
issue from the ground and form a rill whose waters are continuous to the Gulf of
Mexico. If one wishes to "cover" the Mississippi in any sense, one may do
so literally here, where the river is a few inches wide and fewer deep, by lying
at full length on both sides of the stream and drinking out of the channel. This
rivulet is the principal feeder of the Middle Nicollet l., which is of oval figure,
less than &#8531; of a mile long, lying chiefly in the S. E. Â¼ of Sect. 21. The outlet
of this lake is close to the inlet, by a well-defined stream say &#8531; of a mile long,
which starts W., receives a small tributary called Howard cr. from the S., and
then curves N. into the Lower Nicollet l., &#8537; m. E. of the Middle l. This is
in size between the Upper and Middle lakes; it receives two rills, one of them
called Spring Ridge cr.; the Mississippi issues from the N. end of this lake, and
thence pursues a general N. E. course for about Â¾ of a mile in an air-line,
though crookedly and with several small bends, to fall into the head of the W.
arm of Lake Itasca, in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect. 15. On its way it receives
Demaray cr. from the W. Thus is constituted, entirely above or S. of Lake
Itasca, the Infant Mississippi, discovered by Nicollet in 1836, and by him poetically
styled the Cradled Hercules. The cradle is now known as Nicollet valley;
it is bounded on the W. by the Hauteurs des Terres, now Nicollet Heights, and
on the E. by a long, curved, and somewhat broken ridge, which I propose to
call Brower Ridge, after the accomplished gentleman whose name will always be
associated with the history and geography of the Itasca basin. This ridge is the
best walking from Itasca toward the Fons et Origo Springs&mdash;though in the present
state of the ground this is not saying much in its favor, yet this way is less
laborious than following up the Infant Mississippi. The N. end of the ridge
rises on Morrison hill, which overlooks Itasca on the one hand and on the other
gives a fine view of Elk l.; it is only a few steps down to either lake from the
summit, where stands the Brower post of 1887 with its historical inscription, a
sign-board commemorating Nicollet, and a granite bowlder more durably graven
with a less enduring name (not Glazier). Elk l. is the largest body of water in the
bowl after Itasca, being of irregular oval figure, about 1 m. long by two-thirds as
broad. It lies almost entirely in Sect. 22, immediately S. of the head of the W.
arm of Itasca, and thus alongside the Herculean Incunabula, from which it is
separated by Brower Ridge. Elk l. has the bad luck of a bad name, with the
more serious misfortune of a vainglorious record of "exploitation." In the
first place the name&mdash;with due deference to Gen. J. H. Baker, who in 1876
caused "Elk" to become official on the plot of T. 143, R. 36&mdash;seems to me
badly chosen. For "Elk" was originally the English name of Lake Itasca,
translating F. Lac la Biche, and Chippewa Omoshkos Sogiagon; so its transfer
to the smaller lake is liable to create confusion. Better Gilfillan's Lake
Breck, 1881, or Chippewa Gagiwitadinag (embosomed in hills). In the second
place a certain unworthy person magnified the size of this lake, stretched out its
principal feeder southward, lengthened, widened, and deepened its discharge
into Itasca, labeled it Lake Glazier, and trumpeted his false claim of discovering
the one and only true source of the Mississippi, to the scandal of geographical
societies and other learned bodies. The best <i>mot</i> I ever heard on this subject
was given me by a native of Deer River, whose remark, however, is withheld, on
the well-known principle that "the greater the truth the greater the libel." Elk l.
was well described in 1872 by Julius Chambers, who called it Lake Dolly Varden;
its discharge into Itasca is now known as Chambers' cr. This is a small
side-stream about 333 yards long, in the bed of which I walked dry-shod, yet
which has been exploited as the course of the Mississippi. Elk l. has several
feeders, among them three creeks called Elk, Siegfried, and Gaygwedosay&mdash;the
latter for Nicollet's guide of 1836, whom Nicollet calls Kegwedzissag. All the
features thus far noted are in the greater ultimate reservoir bowl, in relation
with the W. arm of Lake Itasca. Turning to the lesser part of the bowl,
whose waters drain into the E. arm, we find a chain of small lakes, whose
names from S. to N. are Josephine, Ako, Danger, Twin, and Mary&mdash;the last
having continuous surface flow by Mary cr. into the head of the E. arm. Such,
in brief, are the main features of the Mississippian waters which drain from the S.
into Lake Itasca; but I suppose there are a hundred little lakes or pools in the
bowl, which seep through the bibulous soil&mdash;in fact, this flowing bowl is full of
lees. The largest lake, which forms its strongest feature, is of a three-pronged or
triradiate figure&mdash;mostly arms, with little body, like a star-fish. It is said that
the early name refers to the head and antlers of the elk, respectively represented
by the three projections. There is not very much difference in size and shape
between them, though each has its particular form. Where the three prongs
come together as the main body of this lake is the small but picturesque Schoolcraft
isl., where the party of 1832 camped July 13th, as Nicollet did in Aug., 1836;
it is decidedly the most eligible spot for the purpose, before making one's periplus
of the lake. The island is in Sect. 11, T. 143, R. 36; its absolute position has
been dead-reckoned by Mr. A. J. Hill to be lat. 47Â° 13Â´ 10Â´Â´ N., long. 95Â° 12Â´
W. Mr. Brower has this summer (1894) set up a very stanch oaken commemoration
post, which bears a suitable legend and looks as if it might stand for a
century. The island was named by Allen (Rep., p. 332). Near it is a shallow
place called Rocky Shoal. The lake is 3&#8532; m. in greatest length from the end
of the N. to that of the E. arm; the ends of the E. and W. arms are 2&#8532; m.
apart. The W. arm is marked off by Ozawindib pt., the E. arm by Bear pt.,
and Turnbull pt. projects into the latter arm about opposite the place where
Nicollet struck the lake in portaging over from Lake Assawa. The best view
of the lake is to be had from Rhodes' Hill, near the base of the E. arm. Itasca
has several feeders besides Mary cr., Chambers' cr., and the Infant Mississippi;
four of these are Island cr., from the W., opposite Schoolcraft isl.; Floating
Bog cr., falling in by Bear pt.; Boutwell cr., on the W. side of the W. arm;
and Shawinukumag cr., a little rill close by the mouth of the Infant. There is
one point about the lake I wish to signalize by the name of Point Hill, after
my esteemed friend, Mr. Alfred J. Hill of St. Paul. When you come to the N.
end of the N. arm, at the usual landing or embarking place, where McMullen's
house stands, your view of Schoolcraft isl., as you look southward up the N. arm,
is intercepted by a promontory from the W. side, near the center of Sect. 2,
T. 143, R. 36; this is Point Hill. The altitude of Lake Itasca is given by
Brower as 1,457 feet; its distance from the Gulf of Mexico, by the channel of
the Mississippi, is probably about 2,550 m.&mdash;by no means those "3,184" m.
which the Rand-McNally map exploits. The general situation is: 150 m. W.
of Lake Superior; 125 m. S. from the N. border of Minnesota; 75 m. E. from
the W. and 252 m. N. from the S. border of the same. The lake is reached
from St. Paul by 240 m. overland; take the G. N. R. R. to Park Rapids, and go
thence in one day by wagon. The distance from St. Paul by the Mississippi is
said to be 560 m.; it is practically out of the question as a route, because of
obstructions to navigation, especially by logging-booms. A much easier way
than I selected for my own excursion is, as just said, to the lake by rail and wagon,
thence down the Mississippi by canoe or skiff to Deer River or Grand Rapids,
where you strike the D. and W. R. R., or even down to Brainerd, where the
N. P. R. R. crosses. The names most prominently associated with discovery
and exploration in the Itasca basin are: William Morrison, 1804; Henry R.
Schoolcraft and James Allen, 1832; Jean N. Nicollet, 1836; Julius Chambers,
1872; James H. Baker and Edwin S. Hall, 1875; Hopewell Clarke, 1886;
J. V. Brower, 1889-94. A more extended historical note will be found beyond;
meanwhile let us return to Pike, at the mouth of Turtle r., on Cass l.</p>

Westminster, Eng., Apr. 30th, 1770, d. Longueuil, opposite Montreal, Canada,
Feb. 16th, 1857, and now with his wife in Mt. Royal cemetery. His activities
compassed half a century, say 1790-1840, during some of which years he seems
to have been almost ubiquitous&mdash;so extensive were his travels, in the service of
the H. B. Co., N. W. Co., and on professional duties in connection with the
survey of the boundary between the British possessions and the United States.
Mr. Thompson was a good practical astronomer and an admirable geographer.
Some of his determinations would not easily be surpassed in accuracy by the
best modern methods. He was also an assiduous journalist, and a good
draughtsman; but most of his work has never seen the light. The manuscripts
which he left are believed to cover the long period of years during which he
traveled and observed; and to include not only his personal narrative, but
also the mathematical tables by which his astronomical observations were
worked out for the determination of latitude and longitude. They have more
than once been drawn upon for historical and geographical data; but no
publication of such a thorough digest of Thompson's life and work as could
have been prepared from these materials under competent and critical editorship
has ever been made. A brief recital of his journeys was read by J. B.
Tyrrell, B. A., etc., before the Canadian Institute, Mar. 3d, 1888, and published
that year, Toronto, 8vo., pp. 28. The official records I have mentioned
must not be confounded with certain fragments of Thompson's MSS., now
the property of a Mr. Charles Lindsey of Toronto, and recently offered for sale.
These are about 600 foolscap pp. in Thompson's handwriting, drawn up very
late in life&mdash;being thus by no means his original journals and field note-books.
Thompson was on the Missouri at the Mandan villages Dec. 29th, 1797-Jan.
10th, 1798&mdash;thus before Lewis and Clark, Oct. 27th, 1804-Apr. 7th, 1805, and
the younger Alexander Henry, July and Aug., 1806. While here he undertook
to determine from Indian information the <i>source</i> of the Yellowstone r., and
made one of the most extraordinary computations on record; for his figures
agree within 20 m. or less with the true latitude and longitude. Thompson was
the first white man who ever descended the Columbia r. from its head-waters to
the point where Lewis and Clark struck it, Oct. 16th, 1806; this voyage was
made in the summer of 1811, and protracted to the Pacific at Astoria. That
journey to which Pike refers was made in 1798. Thompson came down the
Turtle River route to Cass l., late in April, and stopped at John Sayers' house,
located by him in lat. 47Â° 27Â´ 56Â´Â´ N. and long. 95Â° W. If we marvel why such
a man as Thompson missed the honor of discovering the source of the Mississippi,
when that prize was so near at hand, we may remember that the Turtle
River head-waters were already the accepted source, as being the furthest N. Leaving
Cass l. May 3d, Thompson descended the Mississippi through Lake Winnibigoshish,
and so on to the N. W. Co. house at Sandy l.; thence he went up
Prairie or Savanna r., the usual traders' route, portaged over to waters of the
St. Louis, and descended this river to the Fond du Lac house, which stood 2Â½
m. from Lake Superior. This journey was from the post on the Assiniboine r.,
at the mouth of Souris or Mouse r., which he left Feb. 25th; he reached Fond
du Lac May 10th, or in 2 months and 18 days.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-10" id="Footnote_III-10" href="#FNanchor_III-10"><span class="label">[III-10]</span></a> This most celebrated chief of the Leech Lake Chippewas, or Pillagers, had
three names, whose several variants number probably three dozen. One of them
may be written Ask a Buggy Cuss&mdash;for if that is not right, it is as near right as
some others, and easier to say than any of the rest. It is the rule that the name
is different with everyone who uses it, and it often varies with the same author
whose "takes" fall into the hands of different compositors. Some of the
forms I have noted are: Aishkibugikozsh; Aishkabugakosh; Eshkibogikoj;
Esquibusicoge; Aishkebugekoshe and Eschkebugecoshe (in Minn. Hist. Coll.,
V. <i>passim</i>); Eski Bugeckoge (in the French Pike, I. p. 220). The French form
of the name was Gueule Platte; and the English of it was Flat Mouth. Pike
spells the French in half a dozen different ways, the question of gender included
in the variation; while Schoolcraft, who was something of a linguist, is equally
vagarious in this case, giving us Geulle Platte, Gouelle Platte, Guelle Plat,
Gueulle Plat, Guella Plat&mdash;anything you please, except Gruel Plate or Ghoul
Plot! Our Gallic friends themselves tried a variety of combinations, as <i>gole</i>,
<i>goule</i>, <i>gule</i>, before they suited themselves with <i>gueule</i> as a satisfactory substitute
for the Latin <i>gula</i>&mdash;just as we did before we made <i>gulley</i> and <i>gullet</i> out of
the same old Roman stock. On Pike's folding <a href="#abstract">Abstract</a>, the individual whose
mouth, jaws, and throat are so much in literary doubt figures as "Eskibugeckoge,
Geuelle Platte, Flat Mouth, first chief of his band." This was a large
one, best known as the Pillagers, also as Muckundwas, who had long maintained
a separate tribal organization. The medal which Flat Mouth had received from
the British at Fort William on Lake Superior, and which Pike took from him to
substitute an American one, was replaced by a large solid silver one given him
by Schoolcraft July 19th, 1828. The latter author has a long and good account
of this remarkably brave and sensible Indian, who in 1832 seemed to be turned
of 60 years, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high, erect, but inclined to corpulency.
He had been on the war-path 25 times, and had killed a good many Sioux without
ever receiving a wound. He was a man of great discernment and sound
judgment, extensively and accurately informed upon all affairs which concerned
his people or himself. There is much said of him in the Minnesota Historical
Collections from first to last, especially in the Hon. W. W. Warren's History
of the Ojibwas, and Rev. E. D. Neill's continuation of the same subject:
see for example pp. 17, 19, 45, 50, 138, 178, 223, 269, 275, 324, 342, 349, 352,
359, 360, 362, 369, and 459, 463, 465, 475, 478, in Vol. V. of those Collections.
He figured prominently in Anglojibwa affairs for more than half a century, and
was living in 1852, at a supposed age of about 78 years, having been born about
1774. The circumstances under which the Leech Lake Indians received the
names of Makandwyinniniwag, Mukundwais, or Muckundwas, F. Pilleurs, E.
Pillagers, Plunderers, and Robbers, are said in substance by Schoolcraft to be
these: During the period of great irregularities in the fur-trade consequent
upon the transfer of the balance of power from French to English hands, when
the latter were still dependent in part or entirely upon the former for their
clerks and boatmen, and these were in great favor with the Indians, one Berti
came on with goods and took his station at the mouth of Crow-wing r. to
trade with the Chips. But he had more to sell than they could buy, including
guns and ammunition which he knew the Sioux would be glad to get. The
Chips., however, forbade his thus arming their foes; and when he started for
the Sioux country, in spite of their warnings and threats, they arrested him by
force of arms, and robbed him of all he possessed, though they spared his
life. Berti returned to Sandy l., soon died of a broken heart, or of the exertions
he had made to defend his property, and was buried thereabouts. Dr.
Douglass Houghton relates a curious story of this trader's indirect causation of a
terrible smallpox epidemic that ravaged the Chips. The above occurrences
were in 1767-68. When the facts became known to the company at Mackinac,
the Indians were directed to make requital, with threats of punishment
for non-compliance. A deputation went to Mackinac in the spring of 1770,
with furs which were taken as an equivalent for those which had been stolen,
and the Indians were dismissed with a cask of liquor and a closely rolled flag as
a token of friendship. They were enjoined not to broach the one or unroll the
other till they got home. But on the way they did both, and had a drunken
spree with some of their friends at Fond du Lac. Several were taken sick,
some died, and it was soon discovered that the disease had broken out among
them. It was spread broadcast, and is said to have cost many hundred Chippewa
lives before its ravages ceased. Whether rightly or wrongly, the Indians
were always firmly persuaded that a dastardly outrage had been perpetrated
upon them by the intentional communication to them of the disease through the
medium of the presents they had received from officers of the fur company. I
have thus cited Schoolcraft for the popular or traditional as distinguished from
the proper or historical presentation of this case. The facts are set forth at
length in Warren's History of the Ojibways, chap. xxi., forming pp. 256-262 of
Minn. Hist. Coll., V. 1885. The nom de guerre which the Pillagers accepted
for themselves is there rendered Mukimduawininewug (men who take by force).
There appears to be no truth whatever in laying upon the British the infamous
charge of intentional introduction of smallpox. Warren had the facts direct
from an intelligent old chief of the Pillagers, from which it appears that the
terrible epidemic, costing several thousand lives, was introduced on the return of
a war-party of Kenistenos, Assineboines, and Ojibways, who had gone for scalps
to the Kechepegano (Missouri) r., and caught the infection from a village of
Giaucthinnewug (Grosventres).</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-14" id="Footnote_III-14" href="#FNanchor_III-14"><span class="label">[III-14]</span></a> That is, the main party, whom Pike starts off to-day with their guide, in
advance of himself, Corporal Bradley, Mr. "L'Rone," and the two young
Chips. named Buck and Beau. This would be inferred from the above text,
and is confirmed by that of 1807, p. 43, which says that "the men were
marched" Feb. 18th, and Pike with others was "to follow afterwards." I
have no clew as yet to the identity of this "L'Rone." He seems to have been
the guide whom Mr. M'Gillis provided, as Pike says on the 21st, when this
man was bundled back again, that he had then no guide. But in that case,
who or what was the Reale named on the 21st? (See <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43776/43776-h/43776-h.htm#Reale">this name</a> in Index.)</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-15" id="Footnote_III-15" href="#FNanchor_III-15"><span class="label">[III-15]</span></a> Pike is on a <i>Pine River route</i> from Leech l. to Lower Red Cedar l., and
goes across country on a general course about S. S. E., in Cass Co. This much
is clear; but this region is none too well known, and my own information does
not suffice me to attempt identification of the many small lakes he crosses till
he comes to the large Whitefish l. in the course of Pine r. I doubt that we
have data which enable anyone to trail him with confidence. The multiplicity
of lakes and streams of the Pine River connections affords in fact several
ways when the water is open, and when everything was frozen over Pike did not
necessarily take any one of the usual routes. The air-line distance is some
55 m.; but he traveled much further, as he blundered on the way and struck
the Mississippi too low down&mdash;at the mouth of present Dean cr. See <a href="#Footnote_II-47">note<sup>47</sup></a>,
p. 135, and forward, where Pike describes his Pine River journey.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-16" id="Footnote_III-16" href="#FNanchor_III-16"><span class="label">[III-16]</span></a> Not identified; but not to be confounded with the great Sandy l. or Lac
du Sable on the other side of the Mississippi, which Pike reached Jan. 8th and
left Jan. 20th: see <a href="#Footnote_II-49">note<sup>49</sup></a>, p. 138.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-17" id="Footnote_III-17" href="#FNanchor_III-17"><span class="label">[III-17]</span></a> Whitefish or Fish l., as it is still called, is the largest body of water into
which Pine r. expands, but by no means to be considered as its source. Several
large streams fall into it, and the largest one of these is properly regarded as
the continuation of Pine r. This lake begins only about 10 m. (air-line) from
the Mississippi. Nicollet names it Kadikomeg l.; two smaller ones, lower
down on Pine r., he names Plympton and Davenport. Three of this same
connection are now Cross, Pine, and Gear. We know exactly where Pike is
to-day; though his account of what appear to be two? or three? N. W. Co.
houses on this lake is not as clear as we could wish.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-18" id="Footnote_III-18" href="#FNanchor_III-18"><span class="label">[III-18]</span></a> On the up-voyage we figured out camp of Jan. 1st, 1806, to have been between
Dean and Hay crs.; the present pat coincidence confirms the former independent
determination: see <a href="#Footnote_II-47">note<sup>47</sup></a>, p. 134. From Whitefish l. Pike forged ahead
of his party, accompanied by Boley, Buck, and Beau, and bore away from Pine
r. direct for Lower Red Cedar l. He struck one of the little lakes connected
with Dean cr., followed this creek down to its mouth, and recognized this point
on the Mississippi as being a mile below where he had seen the Chippewa canoes
turned up Jan. 1st. Dean cr. empties 3Â½ m. direct, exactly 5 m. by the river,
below Hay cr., about up to the mouth of which he goes to camp to-night, and
easily makes the N. W. Co. house to-morrow. Some points I did not present
in my former note on this locality are these: Between Dean and Hay crs., and
just W. of the "guide meridian" which, N. of the Mississippi, marks the separation
of the 4th and 5th meridian systems of survey, is a very nearly straight
stretch of the river for 2 m., nearly E. and W. This was known to the old
voyageurs as the Grande Avenue. Its W. end is 1Â¾ m. above Dean cr.; its E.
beginning is at a sharp turn of the river Â½ m. below (N. N. E. of) the mouth
of Hay cr., 2Â¾ m. scarcely E. of N. of the mouth of Cedar r.; Pine Knoll is
on this turn. At the end of the first Â½ m. ascending the Avenue, the range
line between Ranges 27 and 28 (of the 4th M.) strikes the Mississippi from
the S., and ends there; this range line is also the inter-county line between Crow
Wing and Aitkin cos. Rounding the bend at Pine Knoll and going less than
Â½ m., one comes to the section line of Sects. 1 and 13, T. 136, R. 25, 5th M.;
this is &#8539; m. from the mouth of Hay cr., and from this point upward Aitkin
Co. is on both sides of the river. Pike's camp of the 24th was within a small
fraction of a mile from the point thus indicated.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-19" id="Footnote_III-19" href="#FNanchor_III-19"><span class="label">[III-19]</span></a> The first chief of the Sandy Lake Chippewas of Pike's time is called on his
<a href="#abstract">table</a> Catawabata, De Breche, and Broken Teeth. The French form is intended
for Dent Breche, and I suppose the more usual term for a person with broken
teeth would be BrÃ¨che-dent. I have seen the word printed as "Brusha." The
native name is rendered Cadiwabida by Schoolcraft, who speaks of him in
1832 as among the dead patriarchs of his tribe. W. W. Warren renders this
more correctly Kadowaubeda; while Neill, with unusual inaccuracy on his part,
speaks of Catawatabeta <i>the</i> Breche, in one place, and Kadewabedas, Breche,
BrechÃ©-dent, or Brechedent, in others. This man was living in July, 1828,
when he visited Sandy l.; he was then the oldest Chippewa chief, having been a
small boy at the time of the capture of Fort Mackinac in 1763.</p>

mileages on the down-voyage, now fairly under way. "Pine Ridge" is hardly a
named locality, though capitalized as such. It is close to White Bear Skin r., the
discharge of Duck and Swamp lakes, near which we set camp of Dec. 29th, 1805.
For a still closer indication of the present camp, take the diminutive Half Moon
l., near the W. bank of the river. The point of the pine ridge is opposite that.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-22" id="Footnote_III-22" href="#FNanchor_III-22"><span class="label">[III-22]</span></a> There is difficulty in adjusting the discrepant records of Mar. 3d and 4th
with those of Christmas week, 1805: see back, <a href="#Page_127">Dec. 17th</a>-25th, and notes
there. The party were then toiling by Crow Wing r., between Ripley and
Brainerd; Pike did not keep with his men, and some of the discrepancies may
be due to actual difference between his movements and theirs. Pike also says,
Dec. 23d, that he was scarcely able to make his notes intelligible. The two
records contradict instead of corroborating each other. Thus, Dec. 17th has it
that the two-barrel cache (pork and flour) was made that day, not the 19th, as
above said; and it was at or near Ripley. Dec. 20th one barrel of flour was
buried; the party were then so close on to Crow Wing r. that Pike got there
early next morning. He did not leave Crow Wing r. till after he had taken the
latitude there, on the 24th. Meanwhile, his men were struggling up to this river.
It is really a small matter, of no more than some 16 m. direct, or 20 m. by the
Mississippi, and thus hardly worth dwelling on; but I like to be accurate when
I can. Pike was camped at Brainerd Dec. 26th and Mar. 2d; he raised his
one-barrel cache of Dec. 20th, near Crow Wing r., on Mar. 3d, and continued on
down to the Nokasippi, which had been passed on or about Dec. 18th, not 21st,
as above; on Mar. 4th he came to the two-barrel cache which he had made on
Dec. 17th, not 19th, as above said, when he was in the vicinity of Ripley; he
continues to-day past Ripley, past his three days' camp of Dec. 14th, 15th, and
16th, above Olmsted's bar, and fetches up to-night opposite his camp of
Dec. 13th, in the vicinity of Topeka. Mar. 5th finds him at his stockade on
Swan r. The camp of Mar. 3d, at the Nokasippi r., is an absolutely fixed
point, as this is the only river that falls in from the E. hereabouts. "Pine
Camp" of the above paragraph is the place where he was camped for three
days, Dec. 14th, 15th, 16th, in the vicinity of Olmsted's bar.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-23" id="Footnote_III-23" href="#FNanchor_III-23"><span class="label">[III-23]</span></a> "Between Pine creek and the post" is a slip for "between Pine <i>camp</i> and

Little Elk r.; Dec. 10th, at Little Falls (city); Dec. 9th, just above Swan r.,
on the other side of the Mississippi. The salute had been ordered by letter
from Grant's house on Lower Red Cedar l.: see back, <a href="#Page_176">Feb. 26th</a>. For "Killeur

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-25" id="Footnote_III-25" href="#FNanchor_III-25"><span class="label">[III-25]</span></a> Possibly a clew here to the unidentified person whose name occurs as Greinyea

is mentioned in Wm. Morrison's letter (elsewhere cited) as one of the five persons
besides himself who formed the party that came into the country from
Fond du Lac in July, 1802. The name stands Greignon, text of 1807, p. 46.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-26" id="Footnote_III-26" href="#FNanchor_III-26"><span class="label">[III-26]</span></a> Pike's observation strikes me as much more "singular" than the Fox
Indian's opinion. Many of us have been taught that the whole world was
once drowned, excepting one favored family, and we have also been told how
it was repeopled. That is one advantage which an enlightened Christian has
over Lo, the poor benighted Indian. The savage simply accepts that one of
the deluge-myths which his own ancestors elaborated to suit themselves. But
the Christian has the Word of God himself, bound up in many different editions
of various dates, for the truth of that particular deluge-myth which the Jews
appropriated, with variations to suit their own tribal vanity, from the Chaldeans.
They invented very little except their precious Jehovah, who was less
polished and less agreeable a god than most of those who were elaborated by
the more civilized tribes who surrounded and generally whipped the Jews.
The Noachian narration, like the Genesis relation of both the Elohistic and
the Jehovistic scribes, was borrowed from one of the myths that clustered about
the legendary character known as Gisdhubar, Izdubar, etc., alleged descendant
of the last antediluvian monarch Hasisadra, who became known to the
Greeks through Berosus as Xisuthros. The original of this deluge-myth was
recovered from the cuneiform characters by Geo. Smith of the British Museum
in 1872, and may be read in English and various other modern languages, to
the great edification of the faithful, no doubt: see it, <i>e. g.</i>, in the charming
and readily accessible book, The Story of Chaldea, by ZÃ©naÃ¯de A. Ragozin, 2d
ed., 8vo, N. Y., G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1888, p. 301 and p. 314. After the aqueous
allegations had been reduced to writing in Hebrew characters, and generations
of Jewish rabbis had tinkered the text to suit themselves with Masoretic
points, and various anonymous scribes had turned it into Septuagint Greek and
Vulgate Latin, some people in England who had never heard of the original,
could not have read a word of it if they had handled the very bricks on which it
was first stamped, and do not appear to have been informed on the subject by
the Holy Ghost, gave us their English version of the words of God duly
"authorized" by "the wisest fool in Europe," as the Duc de Sully called
James I. The most credible items in this account are that the elephant took his
trunk with him and stood behind it in the ark, but that the cock and the fox
were worse off for baggage, having only a comb and a brush between them;
yet I also believe just as firmly that the raven which Noah let fly was the
original progenitor of the Petit Corbeau who lived in the village of Kapoja,
near St. Paul, Minn.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-27" id="Footnote_III-27" href="#FNanchor_III-27"><span class="label">[III-27]</span></a> The phrase which Pike's interpreter applied to the woman was no doubt
"La Bastonnaise." For a long period before and after the end of the last century,
"Bostonian" in some form was the nickname of English-speaking whites,
especially New Englanders&mdash;just as we now say "Yankee." The Indians
picked up the word from the Canadian French, and it passed from mouth to
mouth across the continent; <i>e. g.</i>, it entered the vocabulary of the Chinook
jargon spoken on the N. W. Coast. To cite a case: "On my remarking to Mr.
Frobisher that I suspected the <i>Bastonnais</i> (Bostonians, or English colonists)
had been doing some mischief in Canada, the Indians directly exclaimed, 'Yes;
that is the name! <i>Bastonnais.</i>' They were lately from the Grand Portage,"
etc., Alex. Henry, Trav. of 1761-76, 8vo, N. Y., 1809, p. 329.</p>

wintering-ground in one day from the stockade on Swan r. confirms the
opinion expressed in that note that this place is marked too low on his map (below
Clear Water r.). It also relieves us of the difficulty that seemed to arise
when we were told that Pike did not pass Dickson's place till Oct. 10th, when
we brought him up to St. Cloud. Evidently, then, our adjustment of mileages
and camps of Oct. 8th-10th is right, and Dickson's place was at the foot of the
Thousand Island cluster (Pike's Beaver isls.). The text of 1807, p. 21, speaks
of "the place where Mr. Rienville and Monsr. Perlier wintered in 1797.
Above it is a cluster of more than 20 islands in the course of four miles, which
they named the Beaver islands." As to the name of the person who was with Mr.
Dickson, we have choice of four: Paulier, as above; Perlier, text of Oct. 10th,
of both 1807 and 1810 eds., but Paulire on p. 56 of the 1807 text; and Potier,
on the map. One Antoine <i>Pothier</i>, a trader, is named among Laclede's "thirty
associates" by Billon, Ann. St. Louis, 1764-1804, pub. 1886, p. 18; and it appears
in St. Louis archives that one Isidor <i>Peltier</i> sold a slave to Louis Blouin,
Oct. 7th, 1767. For one <i>Pothier</i>, 1812, see also Wis. His. Soc. Coll., XI. p. 272.
But Pike's man is <i>Jacques Porlier</i>, b. 1765, Milwaukee in 1783, Green Bay in
1791, d. 1839: see Wis. His. Soc. Coll., III. p. 244, VII. p. 247, and TassÃ©,

wintered, and that this place was on a large island. All indications now are
that the wintering-place in question was on the foot of the large island at whose
head are Mosquito rapids, and only a mile or so above St. Augusta, as already
surmised in <a href="#Footnote_II-16">note<sup>16</sup></a>, p. 100. For "a Mr. Greignor," see <a href="#Footnote_III-25">note<sup>25</sup></a>, p. 181. "A
Mr. Veau" is Jacques Vieau or De Veau, b. 1757, d. 1852: see W. H. S. C.,
XI. p. 218. The October date above is provokingly blank for the day of
the month. But I construe the passage to mean that the place where Pike
now is, Apr. 9th, is also the place where Mr. Porlier's brother and Mr.
Veau had wintered 1805-6. If so, we may query Oct. 4th as the missing date;
for though Pike does not say that his camp that day was on an island, the
position of Dimick's isl., to which we then brought him, is such that he can easily
make Rum r. by 7 a. m. to-morrow, if he keeps on "some time" after leaving
the island in question, as he says he does.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-30" id="Footnote_III-30" href="#FNanchor_III-30"><span class="label">[III-30]</span></a> Pike twice passed directly by Dayton bluff, in which this cave was situated&mdash;once
Sept. 21st, 1805, and again to-day: see back, <a href="#Footnote_I-72">note<sup>72</sup></a>, p. 75, for the locality,
and add: The cave which Carver discovered in 1766 is thus described by him, pp.
39, 40, ed. of 1796: "About 30 [say 15] miles below the Falls of St. Anthony,
at which I arrived the 10th day after I left Lake Pepin, is a remarkable cave of
an amazing depth. The Indians term it Wakon-teebe, that is, the Dwelling of
the Great Spirit. The entrance into it is about 10 feet wide, the height of it 5
feet. The arch within is near 15 feet high, and about 30 feet broad. The
bottom of it consists of clear sand. About 20 feet from the entrance begins a
lake, the water of which is transparent, and extends to an unsearchable distance;
for the darkness of the cave prevents all attempts to acquire a knowledge of it.
I threw a small pebble towards the interior parts of is [it], with my utmost
strength: I could hear that it fell into the water, and notwithstanding it was of
so small a size, it caused an astonishing and horrible noise, that reverberated
through all those gloomy regions. I found in this cave many Indian hieroglyphics,
which appeared very ancient, for time had nearly covered them with moss, so
that it was with difficulty I could trace them. They were cut in a rude manner
upon the inside of the walls, which were composed of a stone so extremely soft
that it might easily be penetrated with a knife; a stone everywhere to be found
near the Mississippi. The cave is only accessible by ascending a narrow, steep
passage, that lies near the brink of the river." Now it is easy to criticise such
an account, and those who wish to discredit this honest gentleman seize upon
"amazing depth," "unsearchable distance," "horrible noise," etc. But that is
unfair. These phrases are only Carver's <i>faÃ§on de parler</i> of his subjective sensations;
the objective reality is truthfully and recognizably described. Besides,
one should be sure he is in Carver's cave before he criticises the description&mdash;not
get into another cave and then find fault with Carver because the wrong
cave does not fit the right description, as our friend Schoolcraft did. The cave
which Carver does <i>not</i> describe was not discovered till 1811. Long visited two
in 1817; in 1823 Long's second party visited the New or Fountain cave, and
Keating has left the matter in such clear light that the passage may be transcribed,
I. p. 289, ed. of 1824: "Above this village [of Kapoja], there is a
cave which is much visited by the voyagers; we stopped to examine it, although
it presents, in fact, but little to admire; it is formed in the sandstone, and is of
course destitute of those beautiful appearances, which characterize the caverns
in calcareous rock. It is the same which is described by Mr. Schoolcraft, whose
name, as well as those of several of Governor Cass' party we found carved in
the rock. In his account of it, Mr. Schoolcraft states it to be the cavern that
was visited by Carver, but adds that 'it appears to have undergone a considerable
alteration since that period.' It appears from Major Long's MSS. of 1817,
that there are two caves, both of which he visited; the lower one was Carver's;
it was in 1817 very much reduced in size from the dimensions given by Carver;
the opening into it was then so low, that the only way of entering it was by
creeping in a prostrate position. Our interpreter, who had accompanied Major
Long, told us that it was now closed up; it was probably near the cemetery
which we have mentioned. The cavern which we visited, and which Mr. Schoolcraft
describes, is situated five miles above; it was discovered in 1811, and is
called the Fountain cave; there is a beautiful stream running through it," etc.
I think very likely the cave Long visited in 1817, and thought to be Carver's,
was really the smaller one alongside Carver's in Dayton bluff, of which I am
informed by my friend Mr. A. J. Hill, seeing how "much reduced in size from
the dimensions given by Carver" he found it. Beltrami, II. pp. 191-193, goes
on about Carver's cave in a way which makes one think he entered no one of
the three caves in this vicinity, but drew on his imagination for his description
after reading up on the subject. He uses the phrase "cave of Trophonius,"
and says that "the Sioux call this cave Whakoon-Thiiby"&mdash;a decidedly original
way of spelling it. Featherstonhaugh describes his visit of Sept. 12th, 1835, to
what he calls Carver's cave, p. 257 of his Canoe Voyage, etc., pub. 1847. Nicollet,
who is always to the point, speaks of two caves, one 4 and the other 8 m.
below St. Peters, Rep. 1843, p. 72: "Both are in the sandstone, but at different
elevations. The former is on a level with the river, and is reached through
a short ravine along the limpid streamlet that issues from it. Many authors
have thought this to be the cave described by Carver, but erroneously. It
would, in fact, be only necessary to compare the locality with Carver's description,
to be at once convinced. The cave now referred to is of recent formation.
The aged Sioux say that it did not exist formerly. It has to them no ceremonial
association. They scarcely ever visit it, and there are none of their hieroglyphics
upon its sides or floor. It owes its formation to the dislocation and
decomposition of the upland limestone, which have left sloughy places; the
waters of which have penetrated into the sandstone, wearing it away, and giving
origin to the streamlet which issues from it. The location of this cave is on my
map designated as the <i>new cave</i> [<i>New Cave</i>]. The second, four miles below
the former, is that described by Carver. Its entrance has been, for more than
30 years, closed by the disintegrated dÃ©bris of the limestone capping the sandstone
in which it is located. On the 3d day of July, 1837, with the assistance
of Messrs. Campbell and Quinn&mdash;the former an interpreter for the Sioux, the
latter for the Chippeways&mdash;I set about clearing this entrance; which, by-the-bye,
was no easy work; for, on the 5th we were about abandoning the job, when,
unexpectedly, we found that we had made an opening into it; and although we
had not entirely disincumbered it of its rubbish, I saw enough to satisfy me of
the accuracy of Carver's description. The lake mentioned by him is there; but
I could only see a segment of the cave, a portion of its roof being too near the
surface of the water to enable me to proceed any further. A Chippeway warrior
made a long harangue on the occasion; throwing his knife into the lake as
an offering to <i>Wakan-tibi</i>, the spirit of the grottoes. The ascent to the cave is
by a rapid slope; and on the rocks that form a wall to the left, there are a number
of ancient Sioux hieroglyphics, that mean nothing more than to indicate the
names of Indians that have at various times visited this natural curiosity. On
leaving the cave and reaching the river, a stroll of a few yards to the left, by
keeping close to the rocks, brought us upon a sweet, limpid and copious spring
which had remained for a long time unknown in consequence of the shingle and
brush that conceal its outlet. This is evidently the issue of the waters of Grotto
lake; and their abundance indicates that the lake is well fed, and doubtless
occupies a considerable space within the mountain. On the high grounds above
the cave there are some Indian mounds, to which the Indians belonging to the
tribe of <i>Mdewakantonwans</i> formerly transported the bones of the deceased
members of their families," as is stated by Carver, Pike, Long, and many others.
I am led into this long note partly for the purpose of setting history straight,
and partly from the intrinsic interest of these Stygian caverns, which Pike passes
to-day without notice, as hundreds now do every day and will do until the
places are improved off the earth. The cave that Nicollet opened is the veritable
one that Carver discovered; it is right on the railroad that skirts Dayton bluff,
about a mile in an air-line from Union depot. The New or Fountain cave is
miles away, in Upper St. Paul, near the railroad bridge there, unless it has lately
yielded to the triumph of art over nature and been effaced. Mr. Hill writes from
St. Paul, Mar. 18th, 1894: "Before the shaving off of Carver's cave&mdash;or rather
before our civil war&mdash;the serpent on the roof on the right hand as you stood on
the brink of the waters was very plainly visible, and might have been traced by
rubbing or otherwise; but this would have required scaffolding. It has been
remarked that the serpent was the totem of Ottahtongoomlishcah, one of the
Sioux chiefs of the 'Cave Treaty.' I found by actual measurement that the
extreme length of the lake was 110 feet, before any alteration of the surface had
occurred." See also the article by Mr. Hill on Mounds, Minn. Hist. Soc. Coll.,
VI. Pt. 2, 1891. J. Fletcher Williams, in Minn. Hist. Soc. Coll., I. 2d ed. 1872,
p. 355, notes that there was little change in Carver's cave in the course of a century,
for it was much the same May 1st, 1867, when the Historical Society celebrated
the centennial of Carver's purported treaty with the Sioux. "Within
the past two years, however, sad changes have taken place. The St. Paul &amp;
Chicago Railroad, having condemned for their use the strip of land along the
river bank, including the bluff or cliff in which is the cave, have dug it down
and nearly destroyed it. But a narrow cavity now remains to mark its site.
The pool or lake is gone, and the limpid stream that flows through it now supplies
a railroad tank." But now, says Mr. Hill, "sand heaped from railroad
cutting has again backed up the water into a pool, the receptacle of all filth."
Mr. T. H. Lewis' article, Cave-Drawings, Appleton's Annual Cyclop., 1889, p.
117 (reprint, p. 3), gives the exact position of both the Dayton bluff caves; the
small one, 400 feet above Carver's, is 50 feet N. E. of Commercial St., midway
between Plum and Cherry Sts., at the foot of the bluff; 35 feet long on the floor,
as measured in 1889 to the edge of the water in the rear, 24 feet wide, 10 feet
high&mdash;thus about one-third as large as Carver's. It had pictographs like those
of Carver's cave. None of those Carver mentions were ever copied; his cave
was in part demolished by grading when the railroad first came by, and in the
course of time the walls were scribbled over by the ubiquitous army of idlers
and tramps from whose vandalism no natural formation or artificial monument
in the world is secure.</p>

it obs., and cites in support of def. a passage from the last will of Dean Swift,

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-33" id="Footnote_III-33" href="#FNanchor_III-33"><span class="label">[III-33]</span></a> Joseph Rolette, Sr. There were various persons of this surname, whose
spelling varies as usual. Billon gives one Michel Rolette as a French soldier
who came from Fort Chartres to Laclede's village (St. Louis) in 1764. Pike's
"Mr. Rollett" is the same man as Beltrami's "Mr. Roulet," said in Beltrami's
book, II. p. 174, to have been at Prairie du Chien in 1823, in the S. W. Co.
The Minn. Hist. Coll., II. Part 2, 1864, 2d ed. 1881, p. 107, mentions "the
notorious Joseph Rolette, sen.," as at Prairie du Chien, in or about Feb.,
1822. The memoir of Hercules M. Dousman, by General H. H. Sibley,
Minn. Hist. Coll., III. 1870-80, p. 193, speaks of "the late Joseph Rolette,
senior," as a partner of the American Fur Company, in 1826; again we read
there, p. 194: "In 1834 ... I formed with him [Dousman] and the late
Joseph Rolette, senior, a co-partnership with the American Fur Company of
New York, which passed in that year under the direction of Ramsay Crooks as
President"; and once more, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 199: "In 1844, Col. Dousman was
united in marriage to the widow of his former partner in business, Joseph
Rolette, senior, who died some years previously."</p>

a clutch, and that not oftener than most other birds. But Pike's account of their
vast numbers is not in the least exaggerated. The aggregate of individuals in
existence in the United States during those and for many later years defies all
attempt at calculation. Some single flights have been estimated to include
millions. The settlement of the country, and consequent wanton destruction
during our generation, have exterminated the wild pigeon in some regions, and
reduced to comparatively few its numbers in others.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_III-41" id="Footnote_III-41" href="#FNanchor_III-41"><span class="label">[III-41]</span></a> A sketch of the early history of St. Louis forms pp. 75-92 of Nicollet's Report
of 1843, so often cited in the foregoing notes. It will be well to abstract
here the main historical points of this article, which is not so well known as
everything that Nicollet wrote should be. Some of the following items are adduced
from other sources, as Billon's Annals. Louisiana was ceded by France
to Spain, Treaty of Fontainebleau, Nov. 3d, 1762, ratified Nov. 13th; and by
Treaty of Paris, Feb. 10th, 1763, France and Spain jointly made the cession to
Great Britain. In 1762 or 1763 D'Abadie was director-general of Louisiana
ad interim, vice Governor Kerlerec, relieved. He licensed Laclede, Maxent
(or Maxam) and Co., merchants of New Orleans, to trade up the river. Pierre
Ligueste Laclede, in charge of the party, left New Orleans Aug. 3d, 1763; proceeded
to St. Genevieve and Fort Chartres, Nov. 3d; to the mouth of the Missouri
in Dec.; blazed a site for his trading-post, now St. Louis; and returned
to winter at Fort Chartres, 1763-64. He soon sent to the spot he had marked a
boat with 30 persons, in charge of Auguste Chouteau; they arrived Feb. 15th,
1764 (so Nicollet), or Mar. 14th (Chouteau himself says). The list of the
"Thirty Associates" of Laclede given by Billon, p. 17, is 31, with Antoine
Riviere, who, however, did not go in this boat, but drove the cart which contained
Mrs. Chouteau and four children, and which was escorted by Laclede in
person. Chouteau says that Laclede came there early in April, selected a site
for his own house, and returned to Fort Chartres. He brought his family
in September, and established himself in his new house. The settlement was
made, and at least eight persons were added to the original number by the
fall of 1764. The original name was Laclede's Village. In Oct., 1764, the
infant colony was annoyed by begging and pilfering Missouri Indians. D'Abadie
died Feb. 4th, 1765. Neyon de Villiers had turned over the command of
Fort Chartres, June 15th, 1764, to Louis St. Ange de Bellerive, by whom it
was given over to the British Captain Stirling, Oct. 10th (not July 17th), 1765;
Stirling died in three months, and St. Ange resumed temporary charge of the
fort, pending arrival of Stirling's English successor. British dominion E. of the
Mississippi, already established, was odious; it drove many persons across
the river, and naturally they gathered about the nucleus Laclede had provided.
By the end of 1765 several hundred were there; law was needed, and
a provisional government was set up by general consent in the election or recognition
of St. Ange as governor; this was in effect in April, 1766, with the
first recorded document of a public character; first on record being one filed by
Joseph Labusciere, notary, Jan. 21st, 1766. Laclede, St. Ange, Labusciere,
and Judge Joseph Le Febvre d'Inglebert d'Brouisseau were the four persons
most prominent in moving the wheels of government for four or five years.
The settlement had already outgrown all the earlier ones in the vicinity and
become the actual "metropolis" or capital place in the country. In 1767
the village had perhaps 80 houses, and several hundred people. Late that year
Capt. Francisco Rios or Rivers arrived with some 25 men, sent by Don
Antonio d' Ulloa to take Spanish possession; he could not be conveniently
accommodated, so selected a camp on the Missouri, 14 miles away, where he
built in 1768 Fort Charles the Prince (site of subsequent Belle Fontaine), named
for the one who became in 1788 Charles IV. of Spain. Definitive possession of
Upper Louisiana was taken May 20th, 1770, by Capt. Piedro Piernas, sent from
New Orleans by Gen. Alex. O'Reilly (Oreiley of Nicollet), who had landed
there at 5 p. m., Aug. 18th, 1769. At the close of the French rÃ©gime, 1770,
the village had 100 wooden and 15 stone houses; pop. 500. Before or about
1770, some other settlements were made in the region roundabout; Blanchette
the hunter built his shack on les Petites CÃ´tes, and this place became St.
Charles in 1784; the place to be called both Florissant and St. Ferdinand
was started by FranÃ§ois Borosier Dunegan (so Nicollet&mdash;but query this name?)
FranÃ§ois Saucier settled at Portage des Sioux. The origin of the name <i>Pain
Court</i> is said to be: In 1767, one Delor DÃ©tergette settled on the W. bank
of the Miss. r., 6 m. S. of St. Louis, and was followed by others, all so
poor that when they visited St. Louis, the people there would exclaim, "voilÃ  les
poches vides qui viennent!" "Here come the Empty Pockets!" "But," says
Nicollet, "on one occasion a wag remarked, 'You had better call them <i>emptiers
 of pockets</i>'&mdash;<i>les Vide-poches</i>; a compliment which was retaliated by them
upon the place of St. Louis, which was subject to frequent seasons of want, by
styling it <i>Pain-Court</i>&mdash;<i>Short of Bread</i>." The Vide-poche place became Carondelet
in 1776. Laclede died at the Poste aux Arkansas, June 20th, 1778.
On May 6th, 1780, St. Louis was attacked by Indians and British, and many
persons (accounts differ as to numbers) were killed or captured; it became
known as l'AnnÃ©e du Grand Coup&mdash;year of the great blow. Similarly 1785
was called l'AnnÃ©e des Grandes Eaux, because of the flood in April when the
Mississippi rose to an unprecedented height and inundated the lowlands; it
is traditional that Auguste Chouteau moored his boat and breakfasted on top
of the highest roof in St. Genevieve. The year 1788 was called L'AnnÃ©e des
Dix Batteaux, from circumstances of piracy on the river. The winter of
1789-90 was notable for its intensity. There was no interruption of Spanish
dominion until the cession of Louisiana to the United States: see Lewis and
Clark, ed. 1893, p. xxxiii. and p. 2.</p>

blank p. 106, and thus were appended to the main text of Pike's itinerary, not

Tables go, as nobody ever reads such matter. I leave them where I find them,
on the general principle of interfering as little as possible with the original composition
of the book, simply introducing a chapter-head for their accommodation;
and shall pass this thrilling chapter without further remark.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-1" id="Footnote_V-1" href="#FNanchor_V-1"><span class="label">[V-1]</span></a> Under this head I bring all the matter which formed in the orig. ed. the first
16 pieces, Nos. 1-16, pp. 1-34 of the Appendix to Pt. 1. These fall easily
together, as they consist entirely of letters Pike wrote or received during his
Mississippi Expedition&mdash;even the reports of his Indian councils being actually a
part of his correspondence with General Wilkinson. I am also able to follow
the original sequence of the pieces, with the single exception of orig. No. 16
(instructions to Kennerman), which Pike put last and I bring into chronological
order of dates. The difference of my Arts. 1-18 from Pike's Nos. 1-16 results
from my Art. 3, which had no number in the orig. ed. (it being merely an inclosure
in Pike's No. 2), and my Art. 5, the Sioux treaty, which Pike did not
separate by any sort of mark from his No. 3, though it is by far the most important
piece of this whole lot. The changes I make affect the numeration
after No. 2, but not the sequence in any case except that of my Art. 7 (Pike's
No. 16). I indicate the original numeration and pagination.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-2" id="Footnote_V-2" href="#FNanchor_V-2"><span class="label">[V-2]</span></a> There were three persons of this name down to 1805. Louis Tesson
HonorÃ© 1st, tailor, b. Canada, 1734, d. St. Louis, 1807, aged 73; married

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-3" id="Footnote_V-3" href="#FNanchor_V-3"><span class="label">[V-3]</span></a> This piece is the inclosure mentioned in <a href="#Page_223">Art. 2</a>. In the orig. ed. it had no

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-4" id="Footnote_V-4" href="#FNanchor_V-4"><span class="label">[V-4]</span></a> Doc. No. 3, p. 6-9, of the orig. ed. was printed in a peculiarly misleading
manner. In the first place it was headed in capitals, "Conferences held with
different bands of Indians, on a voyage up the Mississippi, in the years 1805
and 1806," though it was entirely occupied with a single such conference, namely,
that with the Sioux, of Sept. 23d, 1805. In the second place, this major head
was followed by an italicised minor head which properly covered only Pike's
speech on the occasion, yet included the important terms of the treaty effected,
as the latter was tacked on to Pike's speech without any separate heading,
and even without any break in the text. We must therefore break orig. Doc.
No. 3 into two pieces, to be enumerated as Art. 4 and Art. 5. For the
former of these, which is Pike's speech, the orig. minor head of Doc. No.
3 may be retained. For the latter of these, which is the Sioux treaty, a new
head must be supplied; especially as this is by far the most important result
of Pike's Mississippi voyage&mdash;perhaps more important than all the rest collectively&mdash;concerning
which there is a great deal to be said.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-5" id="Footnote_V-5" href="#FNanchor_V-5"><span class="label">[V-5]</span></a> Who the "father" may be whom Pike imposes upon the Indians in his various
powwows is not always clear. Sometimes President Jefferson appears to be
indicated; sometimes General Wilkinson; sometimes Pike himself. In the
present instance it is General Wilkinson, and the Osage mission in mention is
that upon which Lieutenant George Peter had been detailed by the general.
This appears in a letter from General Wilkinson to the Secretary of War, dated
St. Louis, Aug. 25th, 1805, now on file in the War Department, and in the following
extract: "I find our parties under Lieuts. Pike and Peter are making
rapid progress on their routes. Pike had ascended the Mississippi 150 miles on
the fifth day after he left this place, and I have just received a letter from Peters
[<i>sic</i>] dated the 19th inst., 150 miles up the Osage River, altho' he left S<sup>t.</sup>
Charles, 25 miles from the mouth of the Missouri, on the 10th inst. and had
been obstructed by almost incessant rains and consequent high waters. He is
charmed with the river and its banks, which He reports to be far superior
to those of the Ohio in beauty and fertility&mdash;Independent of the immediate
objects of these parties, they serve to instruct our young officers and also our
soldiery, on subjects which may hereafter become interesting to the United
States." George Peter of Maryland was appointed from the District of
Columbia to be a second lieutenant of the 9th Infantry, July 12th, 1799,
and honorably discharged June 15th, 1800; he was appointed lieutenant of
Artillerists and Engineers, Feb. 16th, 1801; of Artillerists, Apr. 1st, 1802;
became captain, Nov. 3d, 1807; was transferred to the Light Artillery in
May, 1808; resigned, June 11th, 1809; and died June 22d, 1861.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-6" id="Footnote_V-6" href="#FNanchor_V-6"><span class="label">[V-6]</span></a>As explained in <a href="#Footnote_V-1">note<sup>1</sup></a>, p. 221, this article requires separation from Art. 4,
from which it is totally distinct, though the two form undistinguished parts of
one Doc. No. 3, of the orig. ed. I accordingly set them apart, and supply a
new heading for Art. 5; but I reprint the latter <i>precisely</i> as it stands in the
orig. ed., for reasons which will presently appear. As originally drafted by
Pike, and by him communicated to General Wilkinson under cover of a letter
of equal date, it appears to have been "scarcely legible," as the general informs
the Secretary of War in a letter before me (see <a href="#Page_232">Art. 6</a>). I doubt that this extraordinary
document ever existed in a form which might not be set aside as fatally
defective; and I do not doubt that we acquired legal title to the lands by some
means subsequent to this invalid instrument. The probability is that upon due
and sufficient investigation of points of law involved it would appear that the
supposed cession of lands was not a legally accomplished fact until made such
by later negotiation or legislation, with which we have here nothing to do. The
following argument concerning Pike's treaty, as simply a starting-point for further
steps in the transaction, was submitted in the press-proofs to my relative
James M. Flower, Esq., of Chicago, who had no material modification to
suggest.</p>

<p class="footnote">Let us first examine that version of the document which Pike presents upon
his own page, and which is therefore presumably authentic.</p>

<p class="footnote">1. The preamble recites that a conference was held "between the United
States of America and the Sioux nation of Indians." But it does not appear
that either of the alleged parties to the transaction was officially and legally
represented. The Sioux nation consisted in 1805 of at least seven tribes, only
one of which was concerned in the affair; and if only the consent of this one
tribe was required to effect the cession the conference is erroneously described.
Furthermore, it does not appear by what authority Pike assumed to represent
the United States. He signs himself "agent" at the conference. Agent of
whom or of what? He was certainly not an Indian agent, empowered by the
United States to effect treaties with aliens; and though it is true that he was
instructed by his military superior to obtain if possible certain cessions, among
which was the cession of land at and near the mouth of St. Peter's r., the
question recurs whether General Wilkinson was competent to issue military
orders to that effect without the authority of the government; and no such
authority is expressed or necessarily implied in the terms of the alleged treaty.</p>

<p class="footnote">2. Art. 1, which ostensibly declares what lands were supposed to be ceded,
does in fact declare or describe no such lands sufficiently or recognizably, and
is furthermore vitiated by a blunder which would constitute a fatal flaw in the
title, if contested. (<i>a</i>) "Nine miles square at the mouth of the St. Croix," is
in the first place an impossibility, because the mouth of the St. Croix has no
such dimensions; and in the second place may mean either a tract of 81 square
miles, whose center is at the mouth of the said river, or any one of four or
more square tracts of the said extent, any one of whose angles, or any indetermined
point of one of whose sides, is at the mouth of the said river; and in no one of
these contingencies is the direction in which the remaining bounds are to be
laid off described either by points of the compass or by natural landmarks. (<i>b</i>)
The asterisk set at the words "St. Croix" refers to a memorandum which
Pike causes to appear as a clause of the treaty itself, interpolated of his own
motion, without the knowledge or consent of the other party to the transaction;
it is also unintelligible on its face. "My demand was one league below." Below
what? Below the mouth of the St. Croix? That would be the obvious inference;
but it would be erroneous to so infer. "Their reply was 'from below.'"
This is absolutely unintelligible as it stands; it has no meaning whatever. "I
imagine (without iniquity) they may be made to agree." Is it Pike's imagination
that is without iniquity? Or is it some agreement that may be brought
about without iniquity between his demands and the terms of the cession? Or
is it the Indians who can without iniquity be made to agree with a demand
that conflicts with the terms of the cession as understood by them? In point of
fact, however, this interpolated clause of the treaty, or interpolated memorandum
relating to the terms of the cession, has nothing whatever to do with the
lands at or near the St. Croix r., because the asterisk which points out the place
of the interpolation is misplaced by error of the types. The words which stand
"St. Croix,* also from," etc., should stand "St. Croix. *Also from," etc.
The printer foiled Pike's intention of placing the asterisk at the beginning of
the clause to which it pertains, by setting it at the end of the preceding clause,
to which it does not pertain.</p>

<p class="footnote">3. Now making the actually required transference of the asterisk to its proper
and intended position (where it stands correctly on a manuscript copy of the
orig. doc. now before me), the whole difficulty which this obnoxious interpolation
occasions is shifted to a much more important clause of the treaty, upon
which it remains in full force. Accordingly we find that this most important
clause beginning "*Also from below," etc., includes an irreconcilable discrepancy
between Pike's demand and the Indians' concession. He appears to have
demanded that the tract of land ceded should begin "one league" below the
confluence of St. Peter's with the Mississippi r.; and the Indians appear to
have agreed, not to this demand, but to a cession of a tract of land which should
begin "from below" the said confluence; though how far "from below" is not
said, and there is nothing to show whether the distance should be more or less
than the "one league" which Pike demanded and to which the Indians did not
agree. But it is impossible, either with or without "iniquity," to come to
any incontestable conclusion concerning a boundary so unintelligibly indicated.
The most we can do is to "imagine," as Pike did, that what the Indians were
willing to cede and did in fact cede by the terms of the treaty, was a tract which
began on one side at no appreciable or no considerable distance below the said
confluence, <i>i. e.</i>, exactly or immediately at the mouth of St. Peter's r. This is a
reasonable and natural, if not the only, inference to be drawn from the obscure
and scarcely intelligible terms of the article in question; and I believe that such
has always been the assumption of its true purport. The initial point assumed,
then, is the mouth of St. Peter's r.; but the article does not show in what, if
any, direction a line is to be drawn through this point for the purpose of establishing
a practicable boundary. No line can be determined by fewer than two
points; yet the article specifies no second point to or from which a line may be
drawn from or to the mouth of St. Peter's r. to represent one side of the tract
supposed to have been ceded. The further terms of the article throw no light
on the case. These terms are only "to include the falls of St. Anthony,
extending nine miles on each side of the river." This clause of the cession does
not specify which one of the two said rivers the Falls of St. Anthony extend
nine miles on each side of, and it is also a natural impossibility for the said falls
to extend any miles on either side of any river. Seeking some other construction
to be put upon terms which are obviously absurd if taken literally, we drag
from obscurity a semblance of meaning they may be assumed to have. This
meaning is, that the tract of land ceded does to all intent and purpose extend
from a point at the mouth of St. Peter's r. to some point in or on the Mississippi
r., at or beyond the Falls of St. Anthony; but to what point is not specified.
However, we may assume that the phrase "to include the falls of St.
Anthony" is to be construed to include no more than these falls. This assumption
gives us a second datum-point of the required boundary, but does not in
any way assist us to an intelligible connection between the first point and the
second one, along which any line can be drawn as a boundary. This deficiency
of any line whatever may be assumed to be supplied by the only remaining
clause of the article, namely, "extending nine miles on each side of the river."
But in what direction are nine miles on each side of the river to be taken? For
anything that appears to the contrary, the distance between the mouth of St.
Peter's r. and the Falls of St. Anthony may be nine miles, and there is nothing
in the terms of the article which forbids the measurement of nine miles to be
made up each side of the Mississippi from the mouth of St. Peter's r. to the
Falls of St. Anthony, and as much further as nine miles may be found to reach.
On such assumption, the cession included only a section of the Mississippi r.,
and not any land on either side of this river beyond its immediate banks; all
that was ceded by the Sioux being in such event a waterway and a waterpower.
To claim as ours by the terms of the treaty any land on either side of the river,
we have to proceed upon yet another assumption, namely, that the nine miles in
question were to be measured in a direction away from the river "on each side."
But even assuming such to have been the intent and purport of the article, several
further questions arise. The first of these concerns the meaning of the word
"each" in its present connection. This word means either one of two or more
things in their reciprocal relation, and thus implies both; in the present instance,
as a river has only two sides, "each side" means both sides. It is clear that a
distance of nine miles is to be measured away from each side of the river, <i>i. e.</i>,
is to include some distance on both sides of the river; but the terms of the
article do not state whether the whole of nine miles' distance from one side of
the river, and the whole of nine miles' distance from the other side of the river,
was ceded, or whether a part of these nine miles on one side and the rest of
these nine miles on the other was ceded; or, in the latter case, what part of
these nine miles on one side and what part of these nine miles on the other side
were ceded. In other words, is the tract of land ceded eighteen miles wide, or
only nine miles wide? In the former case it would of course lie in two equal
tracts, one on each side of the river; in the latter case, its location would be
wholly indeterminate (within certain obvious limitations); for it might be four
and a half miles on each side, or four miles on one side and five on the other,
and so on. Even were all the foregoing questions settled&mdash;arbitrarily, conventionally,
or otherwise&mdash;yet others would arise. Among these would be
the shape of the two lateral boundaries of the tract of land. This tract is
described as "extending nine miles on each side of the river." That is, each
boundary furthest from the river is to be at the same distance from its own side
of the river at every point of its own extent. This requires that these bounds
should be parallel with each other, and such parallelism involves the meandering
of two lines parallel at every point with the meanders of the river. Assuming
that this were satisfactorily done, it would still be impossible to determine the
connection of these two sides of a theoretical tract of land with the other two sides
required for actual boundary. For there is nothing in the article to show the
direction in which either the line which crosses the mouth of St. Peter's r.,
or the line which crosses the Falls of St. Anthony, is to be extended to intersect
any lines, however the latter may have been projected. We are forced to yet
further assumptions, for which the terms of the cession give no warrant whatever.
No determinable shape is given to the tract of land by the terms of the
cession. If we assume that a square was intended&mdash;as was expressly the intention
in the case of the land about the mouth of the St. Croix&mdash;we are confronted
with some terms of the article which put a square out of the question. By these
terms the land can only be a square in case the mouth of the St. Peter's r. be
nine miles below the Falls of St. Anthony, and in the further case that we
measure four and a half miles from one and four and a half miles from the
other side of the Mississippi, and make all connections at right angles by means
of right lines. It is needless to push the difficulty further. Nothing of this sort,
we may be sure, was in the minds of the Sioux at the time, and it may be
doubted that anything of the sort occurred to Pike. The patent fact remains
that even if both parties to the transaction were competent to execute the instrument
by which certain lands were ceded, neither the situation, nor the shape,
nor the size of the tract ceded can be determined from the article of the treaty
relating thereto. How the cession thus left in the air may have been subsequently
determined, it is not to my present purpose to inquire. My contention
is simply that we acquired by Article 1 of this famous treaty no tract or tracts of
land which can be located according to the terms of the article; and that if
there be not a cloud upon the title to every foot of land between and including
Fort Snelling and Minneapolis, and for some distance on each side of those
places, then such cloud has been removed by legislative or other action subsequent
to the supposed cession. It will also be remembered by those interested
in such things that the question has been raised whether the Sioux who seem to
have ceded this land to us had at the time a clear title to it; for Carver claimed,
and some of his heirs have since sought to establish his claim, that the Sioux
had at one time made over to him, for a valuable consideration, certain lands
supposed to be the same, wholly or in part, as those which they made over to
Pike. This case I understand was tried, and decided adversely in law; whether
it be not a good case in equity is another question.</p>

<p class="footnote">4. With the competency of both parties to the transaction brought into question,
and with the size, shape, and situation of the land-grant shown to be indeterminable,
we have next to consider whether Article 2 does not invalidate, vitiate,
or void the whole instrument. In the version which Pike's printer offers us, it
reads: "Art. 2. That in consideration of the above grants, the United States
shall pay (filled up by the senate with 2000 dollars)." This is simply ridiculous.
By the terms of Article 2, the valuable consideration which the Sioux received
is an imaginary nonentity described as "(filled up by the senate with 2000
dollars)." However, this absurdity in the wording of an international document
is so clearly due to the heedlessness of an inexperienced young officer, and
what Pike meant by such phraseology is so obvious, that we can let it go with
only the further remark that the purport of Article 2, as it stands on his page,
is clearer than anything in Article 1. For it is an obvious editorial interpolation
of his own, forming no part of the original document, but simply intended
to inform the reader that at some time subsequent to the execution of the instrument
by the contracting parties, the Senate of the United States voted to fill up
a place which had been left blank in the original document with a clause which
provided that the United States should pay $2,000 to the Indians in consideration
of the grant which the latter had made. But this very fact goes far to
show that the instrument was in the first place fatally defective, no valuable or
any consideration whatever having been originally expressed or implied in the
terms of Article 2. On this point I have carefully examined two manuscript
copies of the "treaty," both made soon after the transaction in question, and
both now on file in the War Department. One of the manuscripts reads:
"Article 2<sup>nd</sup>.&mdash;That in consideration of the above Grants, the United States"
The other manuscript reads: "Art. 2<sup>d</sup> That in consideration of the above
grants the U.Â S." A third version of Article 2, in an official imprint of the
treaty, published by the Indian Bureau, is: "<span class="smcap">Article 2.</span> That in consideration
of the above grants the United States ******" Whence it
appears that the words "shall pay," which occur in the version our young
friend offers in his book, were also an editorial invention of his own; there is
no hint in the original instrument that the United States was to pay anything.
For anything that appears to the contrary, the United States might have
declared war with England, or amended the Constitution, or done nothing, in
consideration of the above grant. Pike could give the Indians no assurance
that the United States would do anything whatever&mdash;that they would even
accept the lands as a gift, because he had no knowledge of future Acts of
Congress, and no authority to make any stipulations which should be binding
on the government. What is perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this
extraordinary transaction is that Pike informs Wilkinson by letter of equal date
that lands to the extent of about 100,000 acres had been obtained "for a
song"; calls the general's attention pointedly to the fact "that the 2d article,
relative to consideration, is blank;" that the "song" in mention was worth
about $250, being the value of certain presents with which he had personally
and privately feed the two chiefs who signed the treaty, these presents being
partly from articles of his personal property; and suggests to the general
"to insert the amount of those articles as the considerations to be
specified in article 2d." General Wilkinson expresses unfeigned surprise at
this, in a letter before me addressed to the Secretary of War, dated St. Louis,
Nov. 26th, 1805, in which he says: "You have a copy of the agreement under
cover, in which, for what reason I cannot divine, he [Pike] omits the stipulation
on the part of the United States;" and again, after quoting some clauses
of Pike's letter to himself, he remarks: "I do not fairly comprehend this
reasoning, but I dare say Mr. Pike will be able to explain it satisfactorily, tho'
it is unquestionable he is a much abler soldier than negotiator." We need
not take the view that this was a shady transaction; yet if Wilkinson had
inserted $250 as the consideration to be paid for the land, no more than this
could have been claimed by the Sioux, and as this was in part Pike's personal
property, some land would have been his own unless he had chosen to make it
over to the United States on being reimbursed in a like amount&mdash;that is, if
such a treaty was worth any more than the paper on which it was written.
The facts appear to be that Pike hobnobbed with two chiefs till he got them to
make him a present of the land he wanted, in consideration of some presents
which he had already made to these two Indians privately.</p>

<p class="footnote">5. The third article of the treaty is intelligible, though it is not clear what
"exceptions" were "specified" in Article 1, as recited in Article 3. The
purport seems to be that the Sioux should retain right of way in the land, and
such other use of it as should not be abridged or nullified by our occupation.
At the same time it is not clear that, since the United States were to have "full
sovereignty and power," by the terms of Article 1, they were not authorized to
withdraw all the privileges of Article 3 if they saw fit to do so.</p>

<p class="footnote">6. The question of the validity of many legal documents is affected by the
presence or absence of witnesses to the same. In the present case no signatures
of witnesses appear on the face of the instrument, and there is nothing whatever
to show that it is anything more than a part of a speech which Pike made to certain
Indians, and which two of them subscribed besides himself. None of the
published versions of the "treaty" which I have seen includes this important
feature. But one of the manuscript copies before me has the names of four
persons as witnesses, all whites. Reference to the second paragraph of Pike's
speech will show him to have spoken of "a form of agreement which we will
both sign in the presence of the traders now present." Four names which appear
on the face of the manuscript copy just mentioned, in the usual place of
witnesses' signatures, and under a word which I make out to be "Tests," (<i>i. e.</i>,
<i>teste</i> or <i>testibus</i>, in the ablative sing. or pl.) are: Wm. Meyer, M[urdoch]
Cameron, James Frazer, Duncan Graham. It is remarkable that, if these names
appear on the original document, they were not transcribed on all the copies, and
also printed with the published versions, as an integral part of the same.</p>

<p class="footnote">7. The names of the two chiefs who are supposed to have "touched the
quill" to this transaction, <i>i. e.</i>, signed with their respective marks, occur in
variant forms in the several copies; but this is the rule in such cases, and has
no significance except of clerical incompetency. In the officially published
version above mentioned the two names stand "Le Petit Carbeau" and "Way
Aga Enagee," each of which only differs by one letter from the correct form
(in the case of the French) or from a usual form (in the case of the Sioux).
Each of these chiefs has been already identified: see <a href="#Footnote_II-2">note<sup>2</sup></a>, p. 85 and p. 86.</p>

<p class="footnote">The subsequent history of this mock instrument or valid document is not
less singular than the conditions and circumstances under which it originated.
Diligent search for it among the treaties duly published in the U.Â S. Statutes
at Large fails to show that it was ever included in that collection of official
papers. But certain facts were furnished, with the text of the treaty itself,
to the Indian Bureau by Mr. C. C. Royce of the Bureau of Ethnology
at Washington, and printed by the former Bureau in an editorial note
explanatory of that text, on p. 316 of its official publication entitled "Laws
of the United States relating to Indian Affairs," etc., Washington, Government
Printing Office, 1884. It appears in this place that the treaty (in
some form) was submitted by the President to the Senate, March 29th,
1808, thus more than two years after the execution of the instrument in writing;
that the Senate reported favorably upon it April 13th, 1808, with the
following amendment to fill the blank in Article 2: "After the word 'States'
in the second article insert the following words: 'shall, prior to taking possession
thereof, pay to the Sioux two thousand dollars, or deliver the value thereof
in such goods and merchandise as they shall choose.'" With this amendment
the Senate unanimously advised and consented to its ratification, April 16th,
1808. Examination of the records of the State Department fails to disclose that
any subsequent action was taken by the President; and the ratification of the
treaty does not appear to have ever been proclaimed. This is a very unusual
circumstance; for such treaties ordinarily have three official dates of as many
stages in their progress from inception to full effect, viz.: date of agreement
between the contracting parties; date of ratification by the proper authority;
and date of proclamation by the President. In the present case the principal
evidence that the alleged cession of lands was ever a legally accomplished fact
is said by Mr. Royce to consist in certain correspondence of the War Department
more than twenty-five years after the date of ratification of the amended
treaty by the Senate. But that the cession was effected, legally or otherwise, is
certain. In 1819 Major Thomas Forsyth, Indian Agent at St. Louis, had
received instructions from the War Department to deliver "a certain quantity of
goods, say $2,000 worth," "in payment of lands ceded by the Sioux Indians to
the late Gen. Pike for the United States": see Forsyth's Narrative, as orig.
pub. in Wis. Hist. Coll., 1872, with notes by Lyman C. Draper, and repub. in
Minn. Hist. Coll., III. 1874, pp. 139-67. Yet we find General H. H. Sibley
saying, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 174: "In the year 1821, Col. Leavenworth called together the
chiefs and head men of the Sioux bands, and procured from them a grant of
land nine miles square at the junction of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers."
What can one make of such conflicting statements? Here it is said that
Colonel Leavenworth procured in 1821 a grant of land which Major Forsyth is
said to have paid for in 1819, and which Pike is said to have secured in 1805.
In the same place General Sibley says that there was an article in the Leavenworth-Sioux
treaty of 1821 by which the Indians "donated" Pike's isl. to Mr.
J. B. Faribault.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-7" id="Footnote_V-7" href="#FNanchor_V-7"><span class="label">[V-7]</span></a> "The within articles" are those of the Sioux Treaty of same date, inclosed

A manuscript copy of the original is on file in the Record Division of the War
Department, together with two copies of General Wilkinson's own letter to
General Dearborn on the same subject and other topics. I might reproduce the
manuscript of Pike's letter textually, but as the copy before me is in a clerk's
hand, its peculiarities being thus not Pike's own, it is not worth while to replace
the above fair imprint of the original with another version which would show no
difference except in its clerical errors. See <a href="#Page_231">preceding article</a> for a criticism of
the treaty itself which formed the inclosure of the present letter. One passage
from General Wilkinson's unpublished letter to the Secretary of War may be
here cited: "He [Pike] tells me he has no doubt of being able to make Lake
Sable in pretty good Season, but observes that the source of the River is in
'Lake Sang Sue,' about sixty Leagues further North &amp; that He must 'see that
also'&mdash;in which case he will have stretched his orders &amp; we shall not hear of

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-11" id="Footnote_V-11" href="#FNanchor_V-11"><span class="label">[V-11]</span></a> The first visit of white men to the Mandans was made in 1738, under the
leadership of Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, otherwise Le Sieur Verendrye. A
relation of this journey, by Rev. Dr. Edward D. Neill, occupies pp. 113-119 of
the Macalester College Contributions, Department of History, Literature, and
Political Science, Second Series, No. 5, which I extract in substance, as follows:</p>

<p class="footnote">On Sept. 24th, 1738, Verendrye was at the confluence of the Red River of
the North with the Assiniboine r. Two days afterward he began his journey
up the latter, and on the 30th, having found a suitable place, he established
Fort La Reine. Within a week, Mgr. de La Marque (otherwise Charles
Nolan, Noland, or Nolant, son of J. B. Nolan and Marie Anne La Marque,
b. 1694), and his brother, Sieur Nolan, with eight men, arrived in two canoes
from Mackinac. On Oct. 16th Verendrye selected 10 of his own men and 10 of
La Marque's party for the Mandan expedition, and their march began on the
18th. The party consisted of Verendrye, with two of his sons; La Marque
and his brother Nolan; together with some voyageurs and Indians&mdash;in all 52
persons. On the 21st, at the distance of 26 leagues from Fort La Reine, they
reached the first (no doubt Turtle) mountain. After slow marches southwestwardly,
the first Mandans were met on the morning of the 28th. A chief came
and stood near Verendrye, and one of his band presented corn on the cob and
some tobacco. These Indians were only covered with a buffalo-robe, wearing
no breech-clout. The Mandan chief requested the French to visit his village,
and left on the 30th, accompanied by about 600 Indians. On the evening of the
third day's march an Assiniboine, one of a number of this tribe who had already
joined the expedition, stole a bag containing Verendrye's papers and other
valuables; two men were hired to pursue the thief, and they captured him. On
the morning of the fourth day's march camp was broken early in order to reach
the Mandan settlement. A short distance from the village they were met on an
elevation by a delegation of Mandans, who presented the calumet. Verendrye
directed his son, the chevalier, to draw up the French in line, place the flag of
France four paces before them, and fire three volleys. At 4 p. m., Dec. 3d,
Verendrye and his associates entered the village and were conducted to the lodge
of the principal chief, where a bag containing presents, and also 300 livres, was
stolen. The Assiniboines were much afraid of the Sioux, from whom they had
separated years before, and the Mandans, not wishing to entertain Verendrye's
escort, purposely raised a rumor that the Sioux were coming, whereupon the
Assiniboines decamped. Verendrye was embarrassed for want of a good interpreter,
but learned that on the banks of the Missouri, lower down, were the
Pananas, and then the Pananis, at war with each other. Six days after the
Assiniboines decamped, Chevalier Verendrye, Sieur Nolan, six Frenchmen,
and several Mandans visited a settlement on the bank of the river, and then
Sieur Verendrye and Mgr. de La Marque inspected the village. There were 130
cabins. A fort was built on an elevation in the open prairie, surrounded by a
ditch about 15 feet deep and from 15 to 18 feet wide. (Compare A. J. Hill's
plot of Mandan fortification, in T. H. Lewis' Minor Antiq. Art. No. iv, p. 5,
1884.) The cabins were spacious, separated into several apartments by thick
planks, and goods were hung on posts in large bags. The men were naked,
covered only with a buffalo robe; the women also, excepting a loose apron about
a foot long. On the evening of Dec. 4th Verendrye's son and Nolan came back
and reported that the village they had visited was twice as large as that where
they were. On Dec. 8th the latitude was taken and found to be 48Â° 12Â´ N. It
was now decided to leave two men to winter with the Mandans to acquire their
language, and return with the rest to Fort La Reine. Before they departed the
head chief was presented with a flag, and a leaden plate upon which the arms of
France were cut. When ready to leave, Verendrye fell sick and could not travel
for two or three days. On Dec. 24th, still weak, he reached the Assiniboine village,
and was agreeably surprised when the box of papers which had been stolen
was returned in good order. On Jan. 9th, 1739, the first height of land between
the Missouri and Assiniboine rivers was reached; here Verendrye remained, while
La Marque hurried on to Fort La Reine. There he arrived Feb. 1st, and sent
back assistance to Verendrye, who reached the post, greatly fatigued, on the 10th
of this month. The two voyageurs who had been left with the Mandans returned
to the fort Sept. 27th, 1739, with reports representing more fiction than fact.</p>

<p class="footnote">In 1740 Verendrye visited Canada, and on Oct. 13th, 1741, he returned to
Fort La Reine. He afterward established a fifth post called Fort Dauphin at
Lac des Prairies, and a sixth, Fort Bourbon, at the mouth of the Poskoyac r.
(<i>i. e.</i>, the Saskatchewan). In April, 1742, the Chevalier Verendrye and his
brother left Fort La Reine, and by way of the Mandan village, on a southwestward
course, are supposed to have reached the Rocky Mountains in January,
1743. The Sieur Verendrye died Dec. 6th, 1749.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-12" id="Footnote_V-12" href="#FNanchor_V-12"><span class="label">[V-12]</span></a> "<i>As they were wont to be</i>" is a particularly fine rhetorical climax to what
our young friend so innocently prides himself on having accomplished. It
must have made the most stolid savage of them all smile in his sleeve,&mdash;or whatever
article of nether apparel he wore,&mdash;as there never had been a time in his
memory, or in the memories of any of his ancestors as far back as his tribal
traditions went in the dim past, when the Sioux and Chippewas were not hereditary
foes, who killed and scalped each other with alacrious and comprehensive
reciprocity. It is true that in rare sporadic cases, when both sets of red brethren
were exhausted in war, or when each found it necessary to let up a little on the
other for a chance to hunt in peace for the necessaries of life, temporary truces
had been agreed upon. But such spasms were supposed by neither party to last
longer than suited the convenience of either; nay, the very councils in which
such a peace was patched up sometimes ended in fresh bloodshed on the sacred
spot; and the annals of all the Indians of North America might be sifted
through and through to discover a more notable case of inveterate, perpetual,
and ferocious warfare than is afforded by the hereditary hostility of these two
powerful nations. Pike was no doubt sincere and veracious in his representations
of the happy results of his peace-making; but his ignorance of the facts
in the case must have been complete, or he would have known that such a truce
as he effected was sure to be broken as soon as his back was turned&mdash;if not
sooner. Furthermore, the expediency of interfering with such affairs may
reasonably be doubted; for, paradoxical as it may appear, a patched-up peace
between tribes whose hostilities are hereditary costs more lives than it saves, and
makes more trouble than it prevents. The vigilance of both parties is relaxed,
private enterprise replaces public policy, and individual murders multiply rapidly
till the normal equilibrium of forces is readjusted by open declaration of
the always existent intertribal hostility. War is the necessary and natural state
of affairs among savages; it is the main business of their lives, and the principal
if not the only means of attaining all that is dearest to their hearts; and it
is better for all parties to proceed on that understanding in a straightforward,
businesslike way than to bushwhack for surreptitious scalps. Such trophies
of prowess must be had in any event and at all hazards; and secret assassinations
to secure them represent in the aggregate a higher death-rate than
that resulting from pitched battles. Meddling with unmanageable things is
never good policy, and interference with intertribal relations of savages is
generally inhumane as well as impolitic.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-13" id="Footnote_V-13" href="#FNanchor_V-13"><span class="label">[V-13]</span></a> The three whose answers to Pike's address are given in this article have
already been sufficiently identified: see back, <a href="#Footnote_III-7">note<sup>7</sup></a>, p. 156, <a href="#Footnote_III-10">note<sup>10</sup></a>, p. 169,
<a href="#Footnote_III-13">note<sup>13</sup></a>, p. 172. It is amusing to observe the unanimity with which they
declined the polite invitation to visit General Wilkinson at St. Louis. Old
Sweet's regrets strike me as the most ingenuous. What was the use of his
going in person if he sent his pipe? If we send our card to a functionary in
acknowledgment of an invitation, is not the etiquette of the occasion accomplished
by that civil ceremony? Sucre's suggestion regarding the Sioux of the
upper Minnesota r., whose intentions were doubtful, was eminently practical&mdash;if
they wanted peace, let them so signify in the usual manner. Chef de la Terre
seems to have been less resourceful in polite excuses than the other two. He
could not go unless Sucre did; but some other day, perhaps, etc. Flat Mouth's
remarks were the most astute. His excuse, whether feigned or not, was good;
but as to his intention of burying the hatchet so far out of sight that he would let
the Sioux strike him even once without digging it up, we may indulge a doubt.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-14" id="Footnote_V-14" href="#FNanchor_V-14"><span class="label">[V-14]</span></a> This is true in a certain sense. When Pike was on Cass l., at the mouth of
Turtle r., Feb. 12th-14th., 1806, he was on a Mississippian water-way of communication
with Red r. and so with Hudsonian waters. But this must not be
taken to indicate that he ever reached the divide between these waters, still less
that he passed to Red r. or Red l. The fact that it has been so taken gives
occasion for this note. For the situation at the dates said, see <a href="#Footnote_III-8">note<sup>8</sup></a>, p. 157.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-15" id="Footnote_V-15" href="#FNanchor_V-15"><span class="label">[V-15]</span></a> Orig. No. 12, though only entitled, "A speech delivered to the Puants, at
the Prairie des Cheins the 20th day of April, 1806," included, besides the
speech covered by this heading, various other matters which came up April 21st,
in another council with the same Winnebagoes, and furthermore gave a report
of a conference with the Sioux, etc. Accordingly, I separate Orig. No. 12 into
two articles, making Pike's speech Art. 15, and supplying a new head for Art.
16, to cover the rest of the proceedings at Prairie du Chien.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-16" id="Footnote_V-16" href="#FNanchor_V-16"><span class="label">[V-16]</span></a> The above paragraph formed no part of the letter to which it is appended,
being an explanatory note which Pike added when he was about to print the
letter in his book. One reason why the Indians did not get the medals they had
been led to expect is evident in the following extract of a letter before me from
General Wilkinson to the Secretary of War, dated St. Louis, Dec. 3d, 1805:
"The Indians in all directions Clamour for Medals, &amp; it is found policy to present
them, but we have not one in the Country, or among the factory Goods&mdash;If
you send any out let them be addressed to the Superintendant &amp; not the Agent,
for many &amp; obvious reasons&mdash;the last aims at too much importance &amp; the former
may need some."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-17" id="Footnote_V-17" href="#FNanchor_V-17"><span class="label">[V-17]</span></a> This is the last letter we have from Pike on the subject of the Mississippi
voyage. It is, in fact, a letter of transmittal of his official report to the commanding
general, and thus a sort of preface or introduction to the whole subject.
In two weeks from the date of this communication Pike had started up the
Missouri on his second expedition, and of course did nothing further with his
Mississippi matters until he had returned from Mexico, the following year.
Article 19 therefore completes the batch of miscellaneous documents, chiefly
letters, which I have grouped in this chapter of "Correspondence and Conferences."
But we have still to deal with four formal articles relating to the
Mississippian voyage; these I make the subjects of the following chapters.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-18" id="Footnote_V-18" href="#FNanchor_V-18"><span class="label">[V-18]</span></a> The reference is here to Captain Meriwether Lewis' Statistical View of the
Indian Nations, etc., which formed the second one of five papers accompanying
President Jefferson's message to Congress, Feb. 16th, 1806: see L. and C., ed.
1893, p. cviii.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_V-19" id="Footnote_V-19" href="#FNanchor_V-19"><span class="label">[V-19]</span></a> Mr. George Anderson, the same who furnished Pike with most of the data
he obtained concerning the fur-trade. See <a href="#Page_274">next chapter</a>, on the commerce of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-1" id="Footnote_VI-1" href="#FNanchor_VI-1"><span class="label">[VI-1]</span></a> This article, for which I introduce a new chapter, with a new major head,
formed Doc. No. 17 of the orig. ed., pp. 35-40 and a folder, of the Appendix
to Pt. 1. The original title of the piece is preserved as a minor head of the
chapter, and this will also serve to effect some sort of typographical uniformity
with the following five pieces, A, B, C, D, E, which are integral parts of the
article, yet were in the orig. ed. separated from the rest of the article under
a different heading, in larger type than the main heading itself; moreover, the
piece marked C, whose proper position was of course between B and D, was
a separate folding blanket-sheet bound to face p. 40, thus coming after E. The
construction of this table is such that it can be printed on two pages of the
present edition, and be put between D and E.</p>

<p class="footnote">Pike's remarks on the fur-trade are sound and very much to the point;
together with his descriptions of the trading-houses, etc., they represent probably
the best account extant of things as they were in 1805. His present Observations,
etc., as well as his correspondence with Hugh M'Gillis (Arts. 8 and 9
of the foregoing chapter, <a href="#Page_247">pp. 247</a>-<a href="#Page_254">254</a>), were extracted for use in the Statutes,
Documents, and Papers bearing on the Discussion respecting the Northern and
Western Boundaries of the Province of Ontario, pub. Toronto, Hunter, Rose
and Co., 1877, 8vo, pp. 318-323.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-2" id="Footnote_VI-2" href="#FNanchor_VI-2"><span class="label">[VI-2]</span></a> The Indian trade is not among the least of the vexed questions which the
United States has sought to answer in the natural and necessary process of
causing the Indians to make their exeunt from the world's stage. The prices
at which goods were sold by private individuals, whether French, English, or
American, seem exorbitant, extortionate&mdash;in a word, monstrous! But trade is
a thing that seems to regulate itself, without regard to theory or sentiment; the
Indian trade certainly did. I once asked the lion-tamer of a popular circus
what was the secret of his profession, expecting some discerning remarks from
him on the power of the human eye over wild beasts, and so forth; but all he
told me was, "You just have to know your lion." In war, trade, or religion,
you just have to know your Indian, as our soldiers, traders, and priests found
out for their respective selves. General Whiting has some extremely moderate
and judicious words on the subject, in his Life of Pike, p. 231 <i>seq.</i>, which I
will reproduce in substance, as it was a part of Pike's business on this voyage
to keep an eye on the Indian traders and trade. The various expenses attending
the transport of goods swelled the original value to such an extraordinary
degree that a knife cost an Indian the ordinary price of a handsome sword,
when he stuck it in his belt; and by the time his squaw had put a yard and
a half of blue strouds around her waist, her lord was in debt for an amount that
would have bought a city belle a ball dress. Such high prices would have been
ruinous to the Indian had not their trade customs furnished a corrective. Few
Indians ever hunted beforehand; they seldom got their stock of skins to offer
for sale at a fair or any price, else the traffic would have been on more nearly
equal terms. They must have their outfit for the chase first, and then they
must feel the pangs of hunger before they would start on a hunt. The trader
was obliged to overcome their indolence by offering certain inducements, besides
furnishing the necessary means. This was an invention of necessity on which
the whole system of credits was based, and on which such a structure of
extortion and other evils was reared. The trader had to let his goods go on
credit into lazy, improvident, always uncertain and often dishonest or criminal
hands, with no security for any adequate return for his outlay except in a scale
of ordinary prices that would cover him in case of extraordinary losses. He
took great risks and put up his premium accordingly. He expected to realize
200 to 250 per cent. on the price of goods for which he got anything, to cover
the loss on what he got nothing for. Thus the Indians were a prey to cupidity
and extortion; they were swindled, as it seems to us. Yet they had a way of
getting even with the most unprincipled trader, sometimes of beating him at his
own game. At the end of the hunt the Indian brought in his peltries. "If
these paid his debt," says Whiting, "which was not often the case, the account
was squared; if an arrearage remained, as was generally the case, no reasoning
nor threats could convince the red man that the responsibility held over to
another season, and that his obligations survived the hunt. When that hunt
terminated, and the furs obtained by it had been fairly rendered, he considered
the account as canceled. Whether it was balanced or not was a question he
did not undertake to answer.</p>

<p class="footnote">"One of the objects Lieutenant Pike appears to have been instructed to
keep in view while on his trip, was the investigation of these evils of the
Indian trade, and to ascertain where proper trading establishments could be
fixed, which were intended to correct them. These establishments were of
course to be made under the patronage of the Government. They were afterward
actually made under the 'factor' system. In a benevolent spirit, the
United States enacted that certain stores should be conveniently placed within
the Indian territory, where factors, having a salary and no interest in the trade,
were to keep on hand a constant supply of articles suitable for the Indians,
which were to be exchanged with them for peltries, the articles bearing only
a fair cost, all expenses included, and the peltries being received at a fair rate.
Government thus, out of kindness to the Indians, became a trader, and a competitor
with individual traders.</p>

<p class="footnote">"The theory was as promising as it was benevolent; but, like many theories,
it did not fulfill expectation when put into practice. It is true that the Indian
under it was sure of a just equivalent for such furs and peltries as he brought
in. This assurance was spread abroad by agents, and was generally known and
understood. But an important consideration had been omitted in the calculations
that suggested the arrangement. Most of the Indians are improvident,
and leave the morrow to take care of itself. The future causes them no
anxiety. It is the present moment, with its gratifications, or its wants, that
occupies, almost exclusively, their minds&mdash;the former exhausted with blind
avidity, the latter borne with passive endurance. They seldom lay up the
means of providing themselves with the small equipments of a hunting expedition.
While they used the bow and arrow, it was different. Then a few hours'
exertion of their own hands provided all that was necessary. But the moment
a gun was put into their hands, their dependence upon the trader was secured.
They must have ammunition, or their guns were more useless than the bow and
arrow; and they could obtain this only on credit.</p>

<p class="footnote">"Hence the United States factor, who had a knife at a few shillings, and
a stroud at not many more, and powder and ball at a fair rate, but who could
sell for cash only, or its equivalent, would find his shelves nearly as full at the
end of the season as at the beginning; while the individual trader, who sold on
credit, though he might sell at an enormous profit, at a thousand per cent. above
his government competitor, would empty his shelves in a few weeks. Besides,
no system can work well unless it is managed well. The factor was expected,
by the law, to be honest and disinterested; and he was often so. Still, he was
in a remote part of the country, and beset by temptations, and dealt with
a people that were supposed to be unable to tell tales that could be understood.
The system was abandoned after a vain experiment of a few years."</p>

<p class="footnote">About the time that Pike was on this expedition, Lewis and Clark also had
their attention turned to the same business. One of the results of their observations
was Lewis' Essay on an Indian Policy, which had special regard to the
commercial aspects of the case, and will never go entirely out of date till the
last Indian has bought his last bullet, or had it fired into him. The reader is
referred to this article, occupying pp. 1215-43 of the 1893 ed. of L. and C.</p>

<p class="footnote">Trade is one of those things which, like a hen hunting for a nest, does best
when let alone. Any hen will lay more eggs and hatch more chicks in a nest
of her own selection than in the most artful contrivances of the coop to provide
for her comfort and convenience. All interference with a man's tendency
to take advantage of his neighbor is unwise, and injurious to both parties. It
tends to sharpen the wits of the one and make him more of a knave than he
was before; while it blunts the wits of the other with a specious sense of being
protected, and thus makes him a bigger fool than ever. Trade being what it is,
in consequence of the great quantity of human nature there is in mankind, can
never be legislated into anything else than an attempt to enrich one's self at another's
expense by buying cheap and selling dear. Free trade in all the markets
of the world is the only natural postulate; all tariff regulations and restrictions
are simply necessary concessions to the inherent weakness of artificial systems
of trade. The evils of damming individual channels of trade&mdash;or rather, of
attempting to dam them with desultory yet reiterated interference&mdash;reach
a climax of absurdity and injury in what is known as tariff-tinkering. Very
likely they ought to be <i>dammed</i>&mdash;all avenues of selfishness ought to be; but
they never will be in this world. As to the practical worldly wisdom displayed
in specific measures to promote commercial activity by legislative interference,
it is probable that any jockey in the land, with a hidebound horse for sale and
some arsenic in his pocket, could give our legislators pointers on those tricks
which are said to be in all trades but ours.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-3" id="Footnote_VI-3" href="#FNanchor_VI-3"><span class="label">[VI-3]</span></a> "A Mr. M'Coy" is not easily identified. I am inclined to think that the
name is McKay or Mackay, and that the person meant is Alexander Mackay, who
had been with Sir A. Mackenzie, left the N. W. Co. in 1810, for Astor's American
Fur Co., and was blown up with the ship Tonquin in 1811; but I am far
from feeling sure of this.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-4" id="Footnote_VI-4" href="#FNanchor_VI-4"><span class="label">[VI-4]</span></a> David Thompson was among the Mandans from Dec. 29th, 1797, to Jan.
10th, 1798. He left McDonald's house, which was near the mouth of
Mouse r., on Nov. 28th, en route to the Missouri. On Dec. 7th he reached the
old Ash house on Mouse r., "settled two years ago and abandoned the following
spring." Being unable to procure a guide here, he took the lead himself
and struck for Turtle mountain, west of which he again crossed Mouse r., and
followed this stream up to the bight of the great loop it makes in North
Dakota, at a point 37 m. from the Missouri. Here leaving the river and coming
south over the plains, he struck the Missouri Dec. 29th, at a point 6 m.
above the uppermost Mandan village. These villages are said to have been five
in number, and to have contained in all 318 houses and seven tents, inhabited by
Mandan and Willow Indians in about equal numbers. (The census of the
Willow Indians is given as from 2,200 to 2,500, in another place in Thompson's
MS., where he calls them Fall Indians.) While among the Mandans Thompson
prepared a vocabulary of about 375 words of their language. He left the
villages Jan. 10th, 1798; but being delayed by storms, it was Jan. 24th before
he reached Mouse r., and Feb. 3d when he regained McDonald's house.
I take these items from J. B. Tyrrell's paper on the journeys of David
Thompson, read before the Canadian Institute Mar. 3d, 1888, and pub. in
advance of the Proceedings, Toronto, 1888, 8vo, pp. 7, 8: see also <a href="#Footnote_III-9">note<sup>9</sup></a>, 167.
Another account of Thompson's travels occupies pp. 94-103 of Statutes, etc.,
N. and W. Bound. Ontario, pub. Toronto, 8vo, 1877.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VI-5" id="Footnote_VI-5" href="#FNanchor_VI-5"><span class="label">[VI-5]</span></a> The <i>plus</i> in the fur-trade was the standard of value, viz.: one prime beaver
(abiminikwa). In the above scale of prices the <i>plus</i> was reckoned as $2. The
scale was a multiple or fraction of this, which answered the purpose of an English
shilling, French franc, Indian rupee, or our dollar. Thus Perrault tells us
that in 1784 a bear, an otter, or a lynx was worth a <i>plus</i>; three martens or 15
muskrats were also a <i>plus</i>; a buffalo was two <i>plus</i>, etc. A keg of "made"
liquor, <i>i. e.</i>, three-fourths water, one-fourth alcohol, with a little strychnine,
<i>Cocculus indicus</i>, or tobacco-juice to flavor and color it, has been sold to many
an Indian for 20 to 40 <i>plus</i>. During my recent canoe voyage to the source of
the Mississippi, I believe that I could have been provisioned, lodged, and transported
by the Chippewas for a month at the cost of a gallon or two of "made"
whisky, had I been provided with that article and disposed to put it to an
unlawful purpose.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-1" id="Footnote_VII-1" href="#FNanchor_VII-1"><span class="label">[VII-1]</span></a> This article, for which I make a new chapter with a major head, was in the
orig. ed. <i>a part</i> of Doc. No. 18 of the Appendix to Pt. 1, running from p. 41 to
p. 56; the remainder of the document&mdash;continuing without break to p. 66, and
including also a folding table&mdash;being an account of the Indians. I make a
separate chapter for this ethnographic matter, <a href="#Page_337">beyond</a>. I retain as a minor
heading of the present chapter Pike's original title of No. 18, nearly in his words;
but must cut it down to exclude "the savages," and in so doing I also reduce its
verbiage a little. As thus restricted, this article is a rapid review or cursory description
of the Mississippi, in so far as Pike ascended and descended this river.
Having already given a copious commentary in my notes on his itinerary, I
must refer the reader back to these for most details; here I simply bracket a
few names in the text for the purpose of ready recognition, and restrict my notes
to new matters which come up.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-2" id="Footnote_VII-2" href="#FNanchor_VII-2"><span class="label">[VII-2]</span></a> The form of the word <i>Mississippi</i> was not fixed with eleven letters till after
1800. President Jefferson, a scholar of his times and especially interested in
linguistics, used nine or ten letters. Our fashion of doubling all the consonants
except the first is distinctly an innovation which has no advantage over <i>Misisipi</i>,
but on the contrary the undesirable effect of obscuring the pronunciation of the
Algonquian elements by neutralizing the vowels. Analysis of the eleven letters
shows three consonantal sounds, one of them repeated, and each of these four
followed by a short if not neutral vowel: <i>Mi-si-si-pi</i>. The initial <i>m</i> is a nasolabial,
not likely to vary, and in fact constant. This is followed by a sibilant
surd, repeated, with probable and actual variation to <i>s</i> of <i>c</i> or <i>ch</i> in one or both
places. The final consonant <i>p</i> is a labial surd, easily and actually variant to its
sonant <i>b</i>. The name is really a term of two words: Misi Sipi=Misi River&mdash;whatever
Misi may mean. Waiving this, and taking the name as one word, the
<i>actual</i> variations which I have noted from time to time may be thus displayed as
regards the eleven letters: (1) <i>m</i>, constant; (2) <i>i</i>, variant to <i>a</i> and <i>e</i>; (3) first
<i>s</i>, var. to <i>c</i>, or missing; (4) second <i>s</i>, var. to <i>c</i> and <i>ch</i>, or missing; (5) second <i>i</i>,
nearly constant, when present; (6) third <i>s</i>, var. to <i>c</i>, not to <i>ch</i>, when present;
(7) fourth <i>s</i>, same as third <i>s</i>; (8) third <i>i</i>, var. to <i>e</i> and <i>y</i>; (9) first <i>p</i>, var. to <i>b</i>;
(10) second <i>p</i>, constant, if not dropped after the third <i>p</i>, never present if the
third <i>p</i> becomes <i>b</i>; (11) final <i>i</i>, var. to <i>e</i> and <i>y</i>. The permutations possible
under the several variants indicated may be ciphered out by those who have
leisure for amusement; probably not one-tenth of the possibilities are actualities
in print; and of those actually existent probably no complete list has ever been
made. We might expect to find 30 forms without much trouble. Some of the
examples I have noted are: <i>Mischipi</i>, Freytas, from Spanish Relations of 1661,
pub. 1663, perhaps the first appearance of the word in print; <i>Messipi</i>, Allouez,
in French Relations of 1667, said to be the original form in that language;
<i>Mississipy</i>, 1671; <i>Messisipi</i>, Joliet, after 1673; <i>Micissypy</i>, Perrot; <i>Masciccipi</i>,
La Salle, qu. misprint in first syllable? <i>Meschasipi</i> and other forms in Hennepin,
1683, and his editors; <i>Messchsipi</i> on an old map, about 1688; <i>Michi Sepe</i>,
Labal, as cited by Brower; <i>Mechesebe</i>, etc. The general evolution of the present
word has been: early elimination of <i>c</i> or <i>ch</i>; tendency of all the vowels to <i>i</i>,
with <i>e</i> in the first place and <i>y</i> in the last place longest persistent; and then
the doubling of the <i>s</i>'s and the <i>p</i>, all the possible cases of this process being
not only extant, but neither very old nor very rare. The unconscious <i>motif</i>
here seems to have been to give the longest river the longest name. There are
many other names of the "Mycycypy" river, aboriginal, Spanish, and French,
for the whole or certain parts of its course. Spanish relations from De Soto
yield for lower parts of the river <i>Chucagua</i> in variant forms; <i>Tamalisieu</i>;
<i>Tapatui</i>; and <i>Mico</i>. Also, for about the mouth, we have <i>Malabanchia</i> or <i>Malabouchia</i>,
from French narration, D'Iberville, Mar. 2d, 1699. An Iroquois name,
<i>Gastacha</i>, is cited. Spanish relations yield several of the earliest names, all of
which have been translated; <i>e. g.</i>, <i>El Rio</i>, The River, Knight of Elvas, pub.
1557; <i>Rio Grande</i>, Grand r., Great r., ref. to Hernando de Soto, near Quizquiz,
Sunday, May 8th, 1541, and at Guachoya, Apr. 17th, 1542; <i>Rio del Espiritu
Santo</i>, as De Biedma, River of the Holy Ghost, with variant spellings of the
phrase, <i>cf.</i> Chavez map, in Ortelius, Antwerp, 1580, and CortÃ©s map for
Spanish Charles V., 1520; <i>Rio de las Palmas</i>, River of Palms, Admiral map, 1507,
pub. in ed. Ptolemy, 1513 (I cite these two without prejudice to the question
whether they did actually apply or were only supposed to apply to the Mississippi);
<i>Rio de los Palisados</i> (as I find it cited, though it seems to me <i>R. de las
Palizadas</i> would be better Spanish for Palisade r., the connotation of this term
being what a steamboat man would mean if he said Snag or Sawyer r.); and
<i>Rio Escondido</i>, Hidden r., because it was hard to find the right channel through
the delta. Certain genuflexions of French knees to powers that were and
happily be no longer, are reflected in the names <i>RiviÃ¨re de la Conception</i>, <i>sc.</i>
of the B. V. M., which Marquette conceived in one of the unisexual transports
of his morbid imagination, June 15th or 17th, 1673, trans. Immaculate Conception
r.; <i>R. de Buade</i>, <i>sc.</i> Frontenac r., as Joliet, who had an eye to a visible
patron; <i>R. de Colbert</i>, as Hennepin, who kept one eye on St. Anthony and the
other on King Louis; <i>R. de Louis</i>, <i>R. de St. Louis</i>, <i>R. de Louisiane</i> of various
F. relations (<i>St. Louis</i> occurring in letters patent of Louis XIV. to Crozat,
Sept. 14th, 1712); from descriptive phrases which are found in Radisson's relations,
Forked r. and River That Divides Itself in Two have been evolved as
names with the aid of capitals; the upper section of the stream, flowing from
Lake Itasca, has been called <i>R. Ã  la Biche</i>, Elk r., from the former F. name
Lac Ã  la Biche, translating Ojibwa Omoshkos Sogiagon; the next section,
<i>Bemidji-sibi</i>, with many variants of this, in Ojibwa, French, Italian, and English;
the next section, <i>R. aux CÃ¨dres Rouges</i>, Red Cedar r., Cassina r., Cass
r.; next section, <i>Winnibigoshish r.</i>, in many variants; and below the confluence
of the Leech Lake fork, <i>Kitchi-sibi</i>, Great r. There are also several forms of
the Sioux name, to the same effect as Kitchi-sibi. I am ignorant of any English
name originally given as a genuine appellation, and not a translation or
mere epithet, like "Father of Waters," and the like. It is text-book tradition
that this phrase translates the Algonquian term; which tradition is too untrue
and too popular to ever die&mdash;let it rest in peace, along with Washington's
hatchet and Tell's apple. It is Featherstonhaugh, I think (I have mislaid the
mem. I once made), who remarks with great gravity and great truth, that
"Father of Waters" is a misnomer, because the river resulting from the confluence
of other rivers is the Son of Waters and not the father of them at all.
This is a sober sort of statement, for a witticism; it is not a figurative locution
or a flight of fancy; it is a solemn fact. It only stops short of the most
comprehensive statement that can be made regarding the origin of rivers,
which is, that all rivers arise in cloudland.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-6" id="Footnote_VII-6" href="#FNanchor_VII-6"><span class="label">[VII-6]</span></a> This description makes in the orig. ed. a 3-page footnote, which I reset in
the main text, as no confusion will come from this obvious digression, the reader
returning to Prairie du Chien in due course. It was furnished to Pike by (Robert)
Dickson, whose name appears at the end. In spite of the mangling of the geographical
names, and one or two sentences that seem to have got awry, it is a
very telling piece of work&mdash;perhaps the most concise and correct statement
extant in 1810 of what is one of the most memorable routes in the annals of
American exploration. It was by this famous Fox-Wisconsin traverse from the
Great Lakes to the Miss. r. that the latter was itself discovered to Europeans.
For it is practically if not identically the route of Joliet and Marquette, 1673.
Under the Canadian governorship of Comte Louis de Buade de Frontenac, who
succeeded De Courcelle Apr. 9th, 1672, the Quebec trader Joliet, the priest Marquette,
and five other Frenchmen, who were at Michilimackinac in Dec., 1672,
passed thence by Green bay of Lake Michigan, Fox r., Lake Winnebago and Wis.
r., to Miss. r. at Prairie du Chien, reached June 15th or 17th, 1673, and named
RiviÃ¨re Colbert after the French king's minister. Our esteemed antetemporary
Jonathan Carver paddled that way too, and so did others too numerous
to mention, among them the macronymous G. W. Featherstonhaugh, F. R.
S., etc., whose canoe voyage up the Minnay Sotor, etc., made in 1835, furnished
data for very readable and realistic gossip, 2 vols. 8vo, Lond. 1847, I. p.
151 <i>seq.</i> The clearest view of the Fox-Wisconsin traverse I have seen is on the
map accompanying Bvt. Maj. C. R. Suter's Rep., being Doc. E of Bvt. Maj.-Gen.
G. K. Warren's Prelim. Rep. Surv. Miss. River above Rock Island rapids,
this being Ex. Doc. No. 58, Ho. Reps., 39th Congress, 2d Sess., 8vo, Washington,
Government Printing Office, 1867, pp. 1-116. Accurate engineering
operations always reduce the mileages guessed at by tired travelers or idle tourists,
but Dickson's estimates come remarkably near Suter's measurements, some
of which are: Lower Fox r., 37Â½ m.; traverse on Lake Winnebago, 15Â½ m.;
Upper Fox r., 104 m.; canal at portage, 2&#8531; m.; Wisconsin r., 112 m.; total,
Green Bay to Prairie du Chien, 271&#8531; m.</p>

<p class="footnote">I may here summarize as curtly as I can the main points of the probable fact
that the Upper Mississippi was reached by practically this route, by Menard
and Guerin, before its long-alleged and generally accepted discovery by Joliet
and Marquette, as above noted. In 1659 Fond du Lac was approached by two
traders, Groseilliers and Radisson; the former was Medard Chouart, the latter
Pierre d'Esprit. Groseilliers, Grozayyay, Desgrozeliers, etc., was b. near
Meaux in France; traded on Lake Huron in 1646; in 1647, married Veuve
Ãtienne of Quebec, daughter of Abraham Martin; in Aug., 1653, married Marguerite
Hayet Radisson, sister of Radisson. Radisson was b. St. Malo, France;
came to Canada 1651, married Elizabeth Herault 1656; was at Three Rivers in
Canada in 1658, and arranged to go with Groseilliers to Lake Superior. The
two built the first trading-post on Lake Superior, at Chaquamegon bay (old
Chagouamikon, etc.). Groseilliers was back at Montreal Aug. 21st, 1660; he
returned to Lake Superior and was at Keweenaw bay Oct. 15th, 1660. Some of
the traders of his party wintered here 1660-61; with them was the Jesuit
Menard, the first missionary on the lake. Menard and one Jean Guerin left the
lake June 13th, 1661, for the region of the Ottawa lakes in Wisconsin. Perrot
says that Menard and Guerin followed the Outaouas to the Lake of the Illinoets
(Lake Michigan), and to the River Louisiane (<i>i. e.</i>, the Mississippi), to a point
above the River Noire (Black r.), where they were deserted by their Huron
Indians. One day in August, 1661, they were ascending a rapid in their
canoe, which Menard left to lighten it; he lost his way, and perished; Guerin
survived. Menard's breviary and cassock, it is said, were later found
among the Sioux. Justin Winsor's Narr. and Crit. Hist. Amer. IV. p. 206,
gives a sketch map on which a place is marked as that where Menard was lost.
This seems to be toward the sources of Chippewa r. If Perrot's relation be
true, and not misunderstood, Menard and Guerin reached the Mississippi via the
Wisconsin from Green bay, ascended it to the Black or the Chippewa, and left
it that way in the summer of 1661, 12 years before Joliet and Marquette came
to the Mississippi.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-7" id="Footnote_VII-7" href="#FNanchor_VII-7"><span class="label">[VII-7]</span></a> Dickson's use of the term "La Baye" requires qualification to prevent misreading
him. 1. The old Baye des Puans or Puants, Stinkers' bay, so called
from the malodorous fish-eating Winnebagos who lived thereabouts, became
from its verdure la Baie Verte, our Green bay, <i>i. e.</i>, the whole water of that
great N. W. arm of Lake Michigan, into the head of which Lower Fox r. empties.
The last 7 m. of this river makes a sort of estuary from the foot of the
last rapids, or head of natural river navigation, to the waters of Green bay;
and this whole estuarian course was La Baye or La Baie of various early writers.
2. The earliest French footing on the estuary was the Jesuit mission at the foot
of the rapids called Rapides des PÃ¨res (Priests' rapids), whence the modern name
De Pere or Depere for the town now at or near the spot, on the E. bank of the
river. The earliest French fort there was called Fort La Baye or La Baie; and
this is the implication of the term as the name of a spot or place on the estuary
also called "La Baye" or "La Baie." 3. When settlement was made under
English occupation it crept down the estuary on the E. side to near the bay,
and "La Baye," <i>i. e.</i>, La Baie Verte, furnished the local habitation as well as
the name of our Green Bay (town), a mile or two above the mouth of the estuary.
4. Under our rÃ©gime, La Baie of the American Fur Company period was
at a place called Shantytown, say halfway between the old French La Baye
(present town of Depere) and the less old English La Baie (present county town
of Green Bay, Brown Co., Wis.). 5. There were other settlements along the
estuary, on the same side too. Thus, writing of 1835, Featherstonhaugh speaks
of the new American settlement of Navarino, "a short distance" from Shantytown;
he describes the latter as "a small bourgade," and locates Navarino opp.
Fort Howard, <i>i. e.</i>, where Green Bay now is. 6. On the left bank, nearly opp.
present Green Bay, but rather nearer Green bay, was the site of our Fort Howard,
which flourished say 60 years ago, and bequeathed the name to the town of
Howard or Fort Howard, now opposite Green Bay. On the left bank higher
up, opp. Depere, is a town called Nicollet, no doubt a belated bud of promise,
as no such place appears on maps of 25 years ago. 7. None of the foregoing
localities or establishments on Fox r. must be confounded with the recent outgrowth
called Bay Settlement, which is out on the S. E. shore of Green bay,
toward Point Sable.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-8" id="Footnote_VII-8" href="#FNanchor_VII-8"><span class="label">[VII-8]</span></a> Kakalin and Konimee of the above text, also Cockien of p. 295, are three
forms of one word which has other curious shapes. Featherstonhaugh I.
p. 162, speaks of rapids "called in the Menominie tongue Kawkawnin, literally
'can't get up,'" and says that the voyageurs make it Cocolo. Suter's text has
Kankarma; his map, Kankana. Present usage favors Kaukauna; so G. L. O.
maps, railroad folders, etc. With the qualifying terms Petit and Grand, or Little
and Great, etc., the word denotes different places and things on the river;
<i>i. e.</i>, certain lower and upper rapids themselves, together with certain settlements
at or near each of these obstructions to navigation. Petit Kakalin,
Petite chute, Little Konimee, Little shoot, Little rapids, designated the lower
rapids; and the town 6 m. above Depere received the name of Little Rapids
or Little Kaukauna. Some miles above this place is now Wrightstown, on the
right or E. bank of Fox r. Between Little Kaukauna and Wrightstown are
obstructions in the river which are or were called Rapides Croches, from their
crookedness. All the foregoing are in present Brown Co. Passing to Outagamie
Co., we find what Dickson called the fall of Grand Konimee, and others
knew as Grand Kakalin, Grand chute, etc. This is now simply styled Kaukauna
falls, without any qualifying term; and the town there is Kaukauna
Falls. Above Kaukauna falls and town, say 2 or 3 m., are rapids called Little
chute (duplicating a different application of the name), and within a mile of
them are others known as Cedar rapids. In this vicinity is also the town of
Little Chute, 7 or 7Â½ m. below Appleton, seat of Outagamie Co. From Appleton
we pass into Winnebago Co., and it is only 6 or 8 m. to where Dickson says
"the river opens into a small lake," <i>i. e.</i>, Lake Winnebago discharges into Lower
Fox r. This outlet is by two channels, N. and S., separated by Doty or Doty's
isl.; here are the Puant, or, as now known, Winnebago rapids; here was the
first Puant or Winnebago village; here are now the cities of Menasha on the N.
channel, and Neenah on the S. channel. The rapids are strongest in the latter.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-9" id="Footnote_VII-9" href="#FNanchor_VII-9"><span class="label">[VII-9]</span></a> Formerly Lac des Puans or des Puants, Stinkers' l., etc. This is the large
body of water in Winnebago, Calumet, and Fond Du Lac cos., 35 m. long, 9 to
14 m. wide, and 12 to 25 feet deep, thus being an extensive overflow of Fox r.,
which enters at Oshkosh, Winnebago Co., about the middle of the W. side of
the lake, and leaves by Neenah and Menasha, at the N. W. corner. The distance
between these points, which was the usual canoe traverse, is 15Â½ m.
There is a small island in this distance, known by the name of Garlic, which
Featherstonhaugh calls Hotwater, from a droll incident he describes, I. p. 174.
The Puant village which Dickson mentions as being at the upper end of the
lake was at or near present Fond Du Lac, the county seat, and one of well
known places in Wisconsin. Dickson's midway "Fols Avoine" village was the
Menomonee settlement on the E. side of the lake, in Calumet Co. (Stockbridge
and Brotherton Res.). Lake Winnebago conveniently divides Fox r. into the
Upper Fox, which runs into it, and the Lower Fox, which runs out of it into
Green bay; it also acts as a sort of reservoir or regulator to prevent freshets in
the Lower Fox. The western shore is now skirted with railroads all the way
from Menasha to Fond du Lac, and various towns are strung along this distance.
Just before Fox r. falls in, it suffers dilatation into what was and is still called
Lac Butte des Morts, the head of which is about 7 m. from Oshkosh; town of
the same cheerful name there now. In this vicinity Loup or Wolf r. falls into
the Upper Fox, after passing through an expansion known by some such perversions
of the Chippewa name as Pawmaygun, Pauwaicun, Poygan, etc.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-10" id="Footnote_VII-10" href="#FNanchor_VII-10"><span class="label">[VII-10]</span></a> This is easier to locate than to tell the name of. It is that dilatation of
Upper Fox r. which lies mainly in Green Lake Co., and for some little distance
separates this from Marquette Co. The lake is 14Â½ m. long, but very narrow.
Rush l. would be the English translation of the Indian name, a few of the
variants of which are Apachquay, Apuckaway, Apukwa, Puckaway, Packaway,
Pokeway, Puckway, Pacaua, etc. Before this notable lake was reached, the
canoes passed the mouth of Wolf r., as above said; of Waukan r., discharging
from a certain Rush l. in Winnebago Co., in the vicinity of places called Omri,
Delhi, and Eureka; a couple of small streams at and near Berlin, Green Lake
Co.; Puckegan cr., the discharge of Green l., which falls in at Fiddler's
(qu. Fidler's?) Bend, on the S.; near this White r., on the N.; present site of
Princeton, Green Lake Co., 12Â¼ m. above Fiddler's Bend; and lastly Mechan
or Mecan r., whence it is only 6 m. to Lake Puckaway. The town of Marquette,
Green Lake Co., is on the lake near its foot; and 7 m. above its head is
Montello, seat of Marquette Co. A stream absurdly called Grand r. falls in on
the S. between Lake Puckaway and Montello. From Montello to Packwaukee
is 8 m.; this is on B&oelig;uf, Beef, or Buffalo l., a dilatation of the river like Lake
Puckaway, but not so wide. There was an old French fort or factory here,
whose name is given as Ganville (qu. Bienville?). The "forks" of Fox r. of
which Dickson speaks is the confluence of Necha r.; but there seems to be
some copyist's mistake about the situation of his Lac Vaseux "ten leagues
above the forks"; for there is no 28Â½ m. of the river left. Lac Vaseux of the
text, otherwise known as Muddy, Rice, and Manomin, immediately succeeds
Buffalo l., being below (north of) Moundville and Roslin or Port Hope. It
seems to be reckoned a part of Lake Buffalo, for the distance hence to the Wisconsin
r. is given as only about 14 m. The canal which Dickson recommends
was long since cut, with a length of 2&#8531; m. to Portage, seat of Columbia Co.
From this place along the Wisconsin r. to the Mississippi, given by Dickson
and repeated by Long as 60 leagues = 165 m., is 112 m. I have not the clew
to the exact location of Dickson's DÃ©tour du Pin or Pine Bend; but I imagine
it was about the situation of Lone Rock, Richland Co., above the mouth of
Pine r., and below the place that Mr. Whitney named Helena, when he had his
curious shot-tower there some 60 years ago.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-11" id="Footnote_VII-11" href="#FNanchor_VII-11"><span class="label">[VII-11]</span></a> The Montreal or Kawasidjiwong r. is a small stream which separates Wisconsin
from Michigan for some little distance, and falls into Lake Superior at
Oronto bay, E. of Point Clinton. The connection with Sauteur or Chippewa r.,
of which Pike speaks, was made by portages from the main E. fork of the Chippewa&mdash;that
is, from Manidowish, Flambeau, or Torch r. But we should note
here that there was more than one recognized route by way of the Chippewa
from the Mississippi to Lake Superior, and in Carver's case, for example, confusion
has arisen in consequence. Thus, some say that Carver left the Mississippi
by way of Chippewa r. This is true; but he did not reach Lake Superior
by way of Flambeau r. and Montreal r. Observing this, some say he reached
Lake Superior by way of the St. Croix and the river he calls Goddard's. This is
true; but he did not leave the Mississippi by St. Croix r. In June, 1767, Carver
came from Prairie du Chien up the Miss. r. to the Chippewa; he went up this for
the Ottawaw lakes, as he calls the present Lac Court Oreilles and some lesser
ones close by; visited the Chippewa town whence the river took its name, he
says, "near the heads of this river;... In July I left this town, and having
crossed a number of small lakes and carrying places that intervened, came to a
head branch of the river St. Croix. This branch I descended to a fork, and
then ascended another to its source. On both these rivers I discovered several
mines of virgin copper, which was as pure as that found in any other country.
Here I came to a small brook," which by confluence of others soon "increased
to a most rapid river, which we descended till it entered into Lake Superior....
This river I named ... Goddard's River," Trav., ed. 1796, pp. 66, 67. A
small river west of Goddard's Carver named Strawberry r., "from the great
number of strawberries of a good size and flavor that grew on its banks."</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-12" id="Footnote_VII-12" href="#FNanchor_VII-12"><span class="label">[VII-12]</span></a> Pike was sadly misinformed on this point. No place on the river is better
known than St. Croix falls, above Osceola Mills, Polk Co., Wis., and Franconia,
Chisago Co., Minn., where the descent is quoted at 5 feet in 300 yards.
Higher up, the river has many rapids&mdash;toward its head so many that Nicollet's
map legends "Succession of Rapids"; Schoolcraft's marks about a dozen; Lieut.
Allen, when abandoned by Mr. Schoolcraft, encountered "almost interminable
rapids"; La Salle cited Du Luth for "forty leagues of rapids," in his letter
from Fort Frontenac, Aug. 22d, 1682; and Hennepin called the St. Croix "a
river full of rapids." They are most numerous and most nearly continuous above
Yellow and Namakagon rivers, two of the principal branches of the Upper St.
Croix, both of which drain from the region about the Ottawa lakes and others
in Sawyer and Washburn cos., Wis. Pike's Burnt r. is supposed to be the
same as Carver's Goddard r.; it is also called Burnt Wood r., from the F. Bois
BrÃ»lÃ©, and the latter name is still in use. Burnt r. is called by Nicollet Wissakude
and by others Misacoda&mdash;a name no doubt the same as Nimissakouat,
Nemitsakouat, Nissipikouet, etc., <i>de l'ancien rÃ©gime</i>; on Franquelin's map,
1688, it stands Neouoasicoton. This last is a specially notable case, as Franquelin
marks "Fort St. Croix" and "Portage" near the head of his river at a certain
"Lac de la Providence" in which he heads his "R. de la Magdelaine";
for these are the Upper St. Croix l. and the St. Croix r. (This post was
probably established by Du Luth before 1684 or 1685; he had been in Paris in
1683; at Montreal, Quebec, etc., 1682 and 1681; and in June, 1680, made the
Bois BrÃ»lÃ©-St. Croix trip from Lake Superior to the Mississippi.) Franquelin's
early map, 1683-84, is said to be the first to delineate the Bois BrÃ»lÃ©-St. Croix
route: this shows R. de la Magdelaine connecting by Lac de la Providence
with R. Neouaisicoton, but no Fort St. Croix is there marked. This river is
said well enough to head in this lake; but more precisely, its sources are in
the feeders of this lake. One of these, which is situated on a pine ridge
a couple of miles off, offers the always interesting, though not very rare case
of a sheet of water running two ways; for this small Source l., as it is
called, discharges one way into the St. Croix stream, hence into the Gulf of
Mexico, and the other way into Burnt r., which takes water to Lake Superior
and finally to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Burnt is navigable, though much
obstructed with shoals, rapids, and falls; it runs in the main northward, near
the E. border of Douglas Co. (named for Stephen A. Douglas), and falls into
the Kichi Gummi, Sea of the North, West Sea, Grand Lac (Champlain's Voy.,
1632, map), Lac de CondÃ©, Lac de Tracy, Lac SupÃ©rieur, Lacus Superior (De
Creux, 1664, map), Lake Algona, etc. There were Chippewa villages along
nearly the whole line of both the rivers at various points, including one on an
island in the Upper St. Croix l. Islands and peninsulas in lakes were always
favorite sites, for in such cases these Indians enjoyed some additional immunity
from the Sioux in what we may style their "moated granges." On the St.
Croix r., low down, was the Chippewa-Sioux boundary line, marked for some

p. 70, for some historical remarks on St. Pierre's r., I wish to add here that
this remarkable stream was at one period the main course of the Mississippi.
The evidence of the rocks supports the opinion that the Falls of St. Anthony
were once opposite the position of Fort Snelling. The Mississippi above the
mouth of St. Pierre's differs in various particulars from the character it acquires
below that point, and was once tributary to a then greater stream. This case
does not seem to have attracted the attention to which it became entitled after
its forcible presentation by General Warren. It is not so well marked as the
obvious case of the Missouri <i>vs.</i> the Mississippi, in which there is no question
which is the main and which the subsidiary stream; but it is similar. In other
words, what the Mississippi is to the Missouri above St. Louis, that the Mississippi
has been to the Minnesota above Fort Snelling.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-15" id="Footnote_VII-15" href="#FNanchor_VII-15"><span class="label">[VII-15]</span></a> Pike's phrase "Le Mille Lac" brings up an orthographic case unique in
some respects. No Minnesota lake is better known than this one; but what
shall we call it? Shall we say Mille Lac, and then call the county in which it
is partly situated Mille Lacs, as the G. L. O. map of 1887 does? Is the single
body of water Le Mille Lac, as Pike says, or Les Mille Lacs? Is this one lake
of a thousand, or a thousand lakes in one? Nobody seems to know; hence a
crop of phrases, <i>e. g.</i>, Mille Lac, Mille Lacs, Milles Lac, Milles Lacs; also,
Mille Lac Lake, Lake Mille Lac, Lake Mille Lacs, Mille Lacs Lake; item, Mil
Lac, Mill Lake, and other vagaries too many and too trivial to cite, all of which
the student of Minnesota geography will discover sooner or later. The phrase
being French, we naturally turn to see what a pure French scholar who was
also a great geographer has to say on the subject. Speaking of the Sioux having
their principal hunting-camps on Leech l. and on "<i>Minsi-sagaigon-ing</i>, or Mille
Lacs," Nicollet explains in a note, Rep. 1843, p. 66: "This name is derived
from <i>minsi</i>, all sorts, or everywhere, etc.; <i>sagaigon</i>, lake; and <i>ing</i>, which is a
termination used to indicate a place; so the meaning of the word is 'place
where there are all sorts of lakes,' which the French have rendered into Mille
Lacs." Whence it appears that <i>Mille Lacs</i> is short for some such phrase as
<i>le pays aux mille lacs</i>, <i>l'entourage des mille lacs</i>, the country full of lakes, the
environment of a thousand lakes, etc. Now it so happens geographically that
this one lake among the thousand is vastly larger than any of the rest, perhaps
than all the rest put together; it is <i>par excellence le lac des mille lacs</i>, the one
among a thousand; furthermore, that it was a Sioux rendezvous, which became
known as Mille Lacs by a sort of unconscious figure of speech on the part of
those who very likely never heard of the rhetorical trope synecdoche, but called
a part by the name of the whole, to suit themselves. I imagine, therefore, that
the seeming solecism of a plural phrase for a singular thing is logically correct;
that Nicollet was right in writing Mille Lacs; that Lac Mille Lacs would be
grammatically defensible, though inelegant; and that we could say in English
Lake Mille Lacs, or Lake Thousand-lakes, with equal propriety, though we
should avoid such forms as Lake Mille Lac, or Mille Lac lake. In fine, the
phrase Mille Lacs has ceased to concern any question of grammatical number,
and become a mere <i>name</i> of two words. As for the pleonasm or tautology of
such phrases as Lac Mille Lacs, or Lake Mille Lacs, etc., this need not disturb
us as long as we continue to talk of "Mississippi river," for example, as that
means "Misi River river." There are several earlier names of this remarkable
body of water. The memoir of Le Sieur Daniel Greysolon Du Luth on the
discovery of the country of the Nadouecioux, addressed in 1685 to Monseigneur
Le Marquis de Seignelay, as translated from the original in the archives of the
Ministry of the Marine, has this passage, as given, <i>e. g.</i>, in Shea's Hennep., 1880,
p. 375: "On the 2nd of July, 1679, I had the honor to plant his Majesty's arms
in the great village of the Nadouecioux, called Izatys, where never had a Frenchman
been, no more than at the Songaskitons and Huetbatons," etc. De or Du
Luth, Lhut, Lhu, Lut, Lud, whatever the trader's name was, had come from
Montreal (Sept. 1st, 1678) with six or eight men to this part of Canada and was in
the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie on Apr. 5th, 1679, under the patronage of Comte
Louis de Buade de Frontenac, who had succeeded De Courcelle as governor
of Canada Apr. 9th, 1672; consequently he named the lake Lac de Buade or
Lac Buade; this was its original denomination in French, and such name
appears on many old maps, <i>e. g.</i>, Hennepin's, 1683, Franquelin's, 1688, De
L'Isle's, 1703, etc., some of which also mark a place by the name of Kathio,
supposed to be the site of a large Sioux village, on the W. side of L. de Buade,
near the base of the peninsula later known as Cormorant Point. Du Luth's
Izatys were Gens des Mille Lacs, <i>i. e.</i>, Sioux who lived about Lake Mille Lacs in
the country of that "number of small lakes called the Thousand Lakes," as
Carver phrases it; they were the Issati or Islati, Issaqui, Issanti, Issanati, Issanoti,
Issayati, etc., meaning those who lived in lodges on sharp stones, <i>i. e.</i>,
Knife Indians, at one of the Mille Lacs called Lake Isan or Knife l.
However loosely Du Luth's term Izatys may have come to be used, it designated
and most properly designates the genuine original Gens du Lac, or People
of Lake Thousand-lakes, our modern Mdewakontonwans. Du Luth's Houetbatons
are supposed to be our Wakpatons, Warpetonwans, or Waqpatonwans;
his Songaskitons, our Sisitonwans, Seseetwawns or Sissetons, <i>i. e.</i>, lake-dwellers
(<i>sisi</i>, marsh or lake, <i>tonwan</i>, people); these two tribes are located on old maps
eastward of Lake Mille Lacs. In 1689, date of Pierre Lesueur's and Nicholas
Perrot's visit to Sioux dominions, we hear that N. E. of the Mississippi lived
the Menchokatonx or Mendesuacantons, <i>i. e.</i>, the same Sioux as Du Luth's
Izatys of Lac Buade. According to E. D. Neill, Macalester Coll. Cont. No. 10,
in 1697 Aubert de la Chesnaye said that "at the lake of the Issaqui, also called
Lake Buade, are villages of the Sioux called Issaqui; and beyond this lake are
the Oetbatons; further off are the Anitons who are also Cioux." Neill also
cites a certain doc., dated Quebec, 1710, which states that "the three bands
with which we are acquainted are the Tintons, the Songasquitons, and the Ouadebaetons."
Two of these are obviously the same as two of Du Luth's; the
third (Tintons) are the same as the Izatys, or rather a band of Indians who
came under this more general denomination. This connection is established in
Hennepin, whose Tintonbas, Tintonhas, or Thinthonhas were Sioux who lived
on the St. Francis (or Rum r., the main discharge of Lake Buade) near the
Issantis, and were the Indians who captured his companions and himself.
This dig at the roots of primitive Sioux ethnology is merely to bring up the
next name of Lac Buade; for, from such intimate connection as this body of
water had with certain Sioux, it immediately became known as Lac des Issatis,
and soon as Lac des Sioux, or Sioux l.; moreover, St. Francis or Rum r.,
which runs out of the lake, became Sioux r.; <i>e. g.</i>, Franquelin's map, 1688,
marks "R. des FranÃ§ois ou des Sioux." De L'Isle's map, 1703, letters the
lake "Mississacaigan ou L. Buade," and the issuant river "R. de Mendeouacanion."
The first of these two Indian names is the one which Nicollet adopts
for the lake in the form Minsi Sagaigoning; the other is the same word as
Mdewakantonwan. Nicollet's remark on this subject, like all his pregnant
writing, requires attention here, especially as it raises a geographical besides a
nomenclatural point, Rep. 1843, p. 67: "We still find some confusion on the
maps as regards the name of <i>Minsi-sagaigon-ing</i>. Some have laid it down as
<i>Mille Lacs</i>; others as Spirit lake; and on others, again, it appears as two lakes,
with (separately) both names. The ambiguity arises from the fact that the same
lake has been named by two nations. The one which I have adopted is from
the Chippeways; that by which it is known to the Sioux is <i>Mini-wakan</i>&mdash;meaning
literally, water spirit; but, in this case, intended to signify <i>ardent spirits</i>.
The river that issues from this lake has been named Rum river by the traders;
which appellation the Chippeways have translated into <i>Ishkode-wabo</i>, or ardent
spirits; and the Sioux into <i>Mdote-mini-wakan</i>, or outlet of the ardent spirits."
That is a dismal aboriginal pun which mixes up nature-spirits with the artificial
product, turns the lake into a bottle, and the river into its neck; it is bad
enough to have been perpetrated "next morning," and it is too bad that the
debauches to which the traders allured the Indians should have been perpetuated
in geographical nomenclature. Spirit l. is the name under which Long, for
example, maps Lake Mille Lacs, and the Gens du Lac he calls People of Spirit
Lake; and Schoolcraft, Narr. Journ. of 1820, pub. 1821, p. 214, has Great
Spirit lake and Missisawgaiegon&mdash;the latter name also applied to its discharge
(Rum r.). Spirit is not now a name of Lake Mille Lacs; the one for which Nicollet
conserved the name Mini-wakan, and which hence became known as Spirit l.
and Devil's l., is the large body of water in N. Dakota, tributary to the Red
River of the North; Spirit l. of modern Minnesota geography is a little one of
the collection in Aitkin Co., between Lower Red Cedar l. and Mille Lacs l.
The latter is the second largest lacustrine body of water in the State. It is
situated across the intercounty line between Aitkin and Mille Lacs, about half
in one and half in the other of these two counties. Its figure is more regular
than usual, being squarish, with three corners rounded off and the S. E. one
drawn out a little; there is also some constriction about the middle, where
points facing each other run out from the E. and W. shore respectively; the
shore line is said to be about 100 miles in all. The lake is readily accessible,
being only some 12 m. S. of Aitkin, and is a favorite resort for outings. One
of the 14 present Ojibwa reservations is on its S. shore.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-16" id="Footnote_VII-16" href="#FNanchor_VII-16"><span class="label">[VII-16]</span></a> There is an error here, as what Hennepin called the St. FranÃ§ois in 1680
is Rum r. of Carver, 1766, and authors generally; while St. Francis r. of Carver,
which he thought was Hennepin's St. FranÃ§ois, is Pike's Leaf r., now

largest body of water into which the Red River of the North expands in Minnesota,
and may be called a principal source of that river, as Pike says, though
it compares with the true source very much as Leech l. or Winnibigoshish l.
does with that of the Mississippi. It is situated about the center of Otter Tail
Co., some 60-70 m. S. W. of Leech l.; Pike's map tucks it up snug under
Leech l. The Leech-Otter Tail traverse, or route by which one passed from Mississippian
waters to those of Red r., as beyond indicated by Pike, is given in detail
by Schoolcraft upon information of traders who were familiar with this chain
of lakes. Using the nomenclature of his Narrative, etc., 1834, p. 105, it may
be stated as follows: From Leech l. through lakes called Warpool, Little
Long, of the Mountain and of the Island, to the Crow Wing series, or Longwater,
Little Vermillion, Birch, and PlÃ©. Lake PlÃ© was the one where the route
forked&mdash;one way leading on down the Crow Wing series, the other turning off to
the Otter Tail series. The latter consisted in, first, a portage of four pauses to
Island l.; portage of one pause into a small lake which led into another, and
this into Lagard l.; half a pause to a small lake; pause and a half to another;
four pauses into Migiskun Aiaub or Fishline l.; a pause into Pine l.; five pauses
into a small river which runs into Scalp l. The latter has an outlet which expands
into three successive and about equidistant lakes, and is then received
into Lac Terrehaute, or Height of Land l. The outlet of this last expands into
a lake, and again into water called Two Lakes from its form; whence the discharge
is into Otter Tail l. It is not easy to pick this exact route up from a
modern map; but I may add that it runs in Hubbard, Becker, and Otter Tail
cos.; that some of the lakes on or near this series are known as Height of Land,
Little Pine, Pine, and Rush (these being on the course of Otter Tail r., and therefore
on the Red River water-shed); and that some places on or near the route are
called Park Rapids, Osage, Linnell, Shell Lake, Jarvis, Erie, McHugh, Frazer
City, Lace, Perham, and St. Lawrence. The N. P. R. R. from Moorhead to
Brainerd crosses the route in two or three places, one of these being between
Pine and Rush lakes.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-20" id="Footnote_VII-20" href="#FNanchor_VII-20"><span class="label">[VII-20]</span></a> Pinenet or pinenett is Pike's version of Ã©pinette of the French voyageurs,
name of the tree we commonly call tamarac or hackmetack, and which the botanists
know as black larch, <i>Larix americana</i>. It is so abundant and characteristic
in some places that the wet grounds in which it grows are usually called
tamarac swamps. The sap pine of the same sentence has been already noted
as the balsam-fir, <i>Abies balsamea</i>: see <a href="#Footnote_II-44">note<sup>44</sup></a>, p. 132. There is a Lac Sapin,
called in English Balsam-fir lake. The supposed occurrence of hemlock, <i>Tsuga
canadensis</i>, in this locality is open to question.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VII-22" id="Footnote_VII-22" href="#FNanchor_VII-22"><span class="label">[VII-22]</span></a> The lake which Pike calls Winipie is the large body of water in British
America, through which the combined streams of the Assiniboine and Red River
of the North find their way into Hudson's bay, and which we know as Lake
Winnipeg; but this does not further concern us now. Pike's Lake Winipeque is
what we now call Lake Winnibigoshish, on the course of the Mississippi. The
French forms of the latter name, such as Ouinipique, etc., whence our Winipeque,
Winipec, Winipeck, etc., are diminutizing terms, as if to say Little
Lake Winipeg. There can be no occasion for confounding the two lakes, notwithstanding
the similarity and sometimes the identity of their names.</p>

<p class="footnote">Lake Winnibigoshish is that very large dilatation of the Mississippi which lies
next below Cass l.: see <a href="#Footnote_III-8">note<sup>8</sup></a>, p. 159, for the distance between the two, and
details of that section of the river which connects them. The variants of its
name are moderately numerous: Winipeque, as above, but Winipec on Pike's
map; Wenepec, Lewis and Clark's map, 1814; Little Winnepeck, Long;
Winnipec, Beltrami, Schoolcraft; Winnepeg and Big Winnipeg, Allen; Winibigoshish,
Nicollet, Owen&mdash;this last the only name now used, generally with
doubled <i>n</i>, and with some variants, like Winnepegoosis, etc. This is the second
largest body of water in the whole Itascan basin, exceeded only by Leech l., and
much exceeding Cass l.; its area is probably not far from that of Lake Pepin,
but the shape is very different. The figure is squarish, with the N. W. and S.
W. corners rounded off, and the N. E. corner extended into a well-marked bay;
the main diameters are about 11 m. from N. to S., and 7Â½ from E. to W.;
the area thus indicated is little encroached upon by projecting points, so that
the shore line is shorter than usual in proportion to the extent of waters; the
collateral feeders of the lake are comparatively few and unimportant. The
lake lies partly in no fewer than eight townships (each 6 Ã 6 m. sq.); but it only
slightly encroaches on five of these, occupying nearly all of T. 146, R. 28, 5th
M., the greater part of T. 145, R. 28, and about half of T. 146, R. 27: actual
area thus equivalent to rather more than two townships, or over 72 sq. m.
The construction of the government dam at the outlet has decidedly altered
the shore line, and modified other natural features; the overflow due to this
obstruction has inundated the original shore contour in the low places, formed
some backwater expansions, and drowned countless trees. Many of these stand
stark and black where they grew, far out from the present shore line, which
itself is piled with drift-wood in most places. Snags also abound all along
the wooded shores, and the water is so shallow that some beds of bulrushes rise
above the surface a mile or more from land. The scene is desolate and forbidding.
Add to this a danger of navigation to an unusual degree for the frail
birch-bark canoes which alone are used on Winnibigoshish. The lake is too
large to be safely crossed in such boats at any time. Even the Indians habitually
sneak to the shore through the snags and rushes; for the water is very shallow,
easily churned up to quite a sea. Sudden squalls and shifting currents are
always to be expected, and one runs considerable risk in venturing where land
cannot be made in a few minutes, if necessary. It would be nothing, of course,
to a well-built keel-boat with sail and oars; but a birch-bark is quite another
craft. I have seen Winnibigoshish as smooth as glass, and then in a few minutes
been glad to put ashore, to escape a choice between swamping or capsizing,
amid whitecaps and combers at least four feet from crest to hollow, breaking
on a lee shore full of snags and piled with driftwood. Good landing places are
not to be found all along; most of the shore is low, and much of it consists of
floating-bog, in which a man may sink as easily, and less cleanly, than in quicksand,
if he sets an incautious foot. The water is so impure as to be scarcely
fit for drinking; the lake is a sort of cesspool for all the sewerage of the basin
whose waters pass through it. Winnibigoshish, in short, is dreary, dirty,
deceitful, and dangerous.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Mississippi enters this reservoir in the S. W. part, at a point in the S. W.
Â¼ of Sect. 36, T. 146, R. 29, 5th M., where it sweeps around a firm bank,
steep enough to be cut in some places, and on which some Indians live; quite
a little delta extends far out into the lake, overgrown with bulrushes to such
an extent as to hide the opening. But it is not difficult to thread any one of
several ways through these to the high bank just said, which is the land-mark;
a more conspicuous one, from a distance, is a piece of high woodland whose
point is due S. Â½ m. from the inlet. Hence southward is the nearest approach
of Leech l.; a traverse offers by means of Portage l. (Nicollet's Lake Duponceau),
though the carrying-place is somewhat over 2 m. long.</p>

<p class="footnote">Passing northward, to our left as we start from the Mississippian inlet to go
around the shore, the first prominent feature is Raven's point, distant from the
inlet 4 m. The maps all represent this as much longer and sharper than it
looked to my eye; probably much of the point that was once land is now under
water, owing to the dam. It is the site of a squalid village of Chippewas,
who have been civilized into the whole assortment of our own vices. A considerable
stream falls in here, which I suppose is Kaminaigokag r. of Nicollet and
Owen, though it is nameless on more modern maps. Its mouth is in Sect. 18,
T. 146, R. 29, close to the N. border of Sect. 19; near by is a lake about a mile
in diameter, probably due to overflowage. Rounding Raven's point and proceeding
N. 4 m. further, we come to a little bay into which flows a considerable
stream from the W. This is Third r., often marked "III. R." The reason for
this name will presently appear. Schoolcraft in Narr. Journey of 1820, pub.
1821, p. 246, calls it "Thornberry river, or La riviÃ¨re des Epinettes," but F.
<i>Ã©pinette</i> does not mean "thornberry": see <a href="#Footnote_VII-20">note<sup>20</sup></a>, p. 319. The mouth of Third
r. falls in the N. W. Â¼ of Sect. 33, T. 147, R. 28. Coasting now E. along the N.
shore, we round the prominence which defines Third River bay, and which I call
Windy pt. from my experience there&mdash;it had no name that I could discover. It
consists of a floating-bog for some distance back, and in this morass, further eastward,
a small creek empties in Sect. 35 of the T. and R. last said; this may be
called Bog cr., if no earlier name can be found; it is not one of the regularly
enumerated streams. A mile and a half eastward of Bog cr., nearly or exactly
on the line between Sect. 36 of the same township and Sect. 31 of T. 147, R.
27, is the mouth of Pigeon r. No other name is heard on the spot; but this
is Second r. or "II. R." of the geographers. Schoolcraft, <i>l. c.</i>, called it Round
Lake r., and Round l. is present name of its principal source. There is a good
landing here on a bit of beach under a firm, bluffy bank, the site of the most decent
and well-to-do Chippewa village about the lake. Three and a half miles E.
S. E. of Pigeon r. is the wide, irregular opening of Cut Foot Sioux r., otherwise
First r., or "I. R.," which discharges from a system of lakes, the nearest one of
which is marked Cut Toe l. by Owen, and Keeskeesedatpun l. on the Jewett
map of 1890. This is the river called Turtle Portage r. by Schoolcraft, <i>l. c.</i>
Several houses stand on and under the high land on the E. or left bank, a fraction
of a mile back of the opening, among them the trading-house of one
Fairbanks, where the usual robberies are perpetrated under another name,
but without further pretense of any sort. Four miles from the mouth of the
Cut Foot Sioux, in a direction about S. S. E., is the outlet of the Mississippi, at
the bottom of a large bay, offset from the rest of the lake by prominent points
of land. The separation of this bay from the main body of waters is scarcely
less well-marked than that of Pike bay from the rest of Cass l. I propose to
call it Dam bay. The points of land which delimit its opening into Lake Winnibigoshish
are: A long linguiform extension from the S., occupying all the ground
not overflowed of Sects. 15 and 16, T. 146, R. 27, which may be designated
Tongue pt.; and opposite this, on the N., a much less extensive prominence,
which may become known as Rush pt., in Sect. 10 of the T. and R. last
said. Paddling 1Â½ m. from Cut Foot Sioux r., we go through the strait between
Tongue and Rush pts., and are then in Dam bay, a roundish body of
water about 2Â½ m. in diameter. At the S. end of this is the short thoroughfare
(outlet of the Mississippi), less than a mile long, which leads into Little Lake
Winnibigoshish, and has been dammed at its lower end, in the S. W. Â¼ of Sect.
25, necessitating, of course, a portage of a few yards in canoeing. The dam in
part consists of a solid embankment, stretching from the S.; the rest is the
wooden construction for raising and lowering a series of gates by which the flow
of water can be regulated. This work looks sadly in need of repair, and is said
to be none too secure. At the N. end of the dam is a high wooded hill, a
fine spring of water, and some vacant buildings; on the other side is a narrow
pond over a mile long, called Rice l.</p>

<p class="footnote">Immediately below the dam, the Mississippi dilates into Little Lake Winnibigoshish
(once Rush l.), of irregularly oval figure, 2Â¾ m. long by scarcely over
1 m. in greatest breadth, its longest diameter about N. W. to S. E. At a point
near the S. E. is the portage, or carrying place, over to Ball Club l., whose
head is there distant about a mile: see <a href="#Footnote_II-56">note<sup>56</sup></a>, p. 150. The outlet of the Mississippi
is on the S., in the N. W. Â¼ Sect. 6, T. 145, R. 26. Thence the
river flows scarcely W. of S. for 3 m. direct, but I judge fully 6Â½ by its extremely
tortuous channel, to a place in Sect. 24, T. 145, R. 27, where some
rapids occur; these, however, are easily shot. The further course of the river
is S. E., 8 m. direct, but more than twice as far by the bends, to the confluence
of Leech Lake r., or Pike's "Forks of the Mississippi": see back, <a href="#Footnote_II-56">note
last cited</a>, p. 151. This whole section of the Mississippi, from Little Lake
Winnibigoshish to the mouth of Leech Lake r., is easy canoeing down, with
plenty of smooth, swift water, even at low stages, and good places to camp all
along on the wooded points against which the channel continually abuts as it
bends from side to side of the low bottom-land, mostly overgrown with reeds
(<i>Phragmites communis</i>) and bulrushes (<i>Scirpus lacustris</i>), but toward Leech
Lake r. becoming meadowy and thus fit for haying. Besides the main bends,
or regular channel, there are a great many minor sluices or cut-offs, practicable
for canoeists; and one is borne quickly along by the current, without minding
much whether one is in the channel or not. This way down, though circuitous
and several times as far as the route by Ball Club l., which lies off to the left as
you descend, is decidedly preferable; but going up river I should advise one

Itasca. He wintered at Lac la Folle, 1803-4, visited Lake Itasca in 1804, and
again in 1811 or 1812. Mr. Morrison was b. Canada, 1783, d. there Aug. 9th,
1866. He kept a journal, which was lost, of his movements before 1824. He
described "Elk" l. to his daughter, Mrs. Georgiana Demaray, and various
other persons; he considered and declared himself the first of white men at the
source, though his claim does not appear to have become a matter of authentic,
citable publication till 1856: see Final Rep. Minn. Geol. Surv., I. p. 26. The
document on which his claim mainly rests is the extant original of a letter addressed
by William to his brother Allan, dated Berthier, Jan. 16th, 1856. This
is published verbatim in Brower's Report, Minn. Hist. Soc. Coll., VII. 1893,
pp. 122-124. Brower says (<i>l. c.</i> p. 120) that the "Morrison letter," as originally
published in Minn. Hist. Soc. Coll., I. 1856, pp. 103, 104, or 2d ed., 1872,
pp. 417-419, is "a composite production." The article there covering the William
Morrison letter is entitled "Who Discovered Itasca Lake?" and includes a letter
from Allan Morrison to General Alexander Ramsay (now ex-Secretary of War and
President of the Society), dated Crow Wing, Benton County, M. T., Feb. 17th,
1856. Charles Hallock, Esq., formerly of New York, the well-known author
of the Sportsman's Gazetteer and many other works, founder of the Forest and
Stream weekly in New York, and of the town of Hallock, now the seat of
Kittson Co., Minn., published a version of the "Morrison letter," said to be a
"correct copy," in his article The Red River Trail, Harper's Mag. XIX. No.
cix, June, 1859, p. 37, which aroused the jealous recalcitration of Mr. Schoolcraft,
whose reclamation was made in a letter to George H. Moore, Esq., Librarian
of the New York Historical Society, dated Washington, Aug. 12th, 1859,
and published in the N. Y. Evening Post, Aug. 23d, 1859, p. 1, column 4. I
have not inspected Morrison's autograph letter; but I have compared the three
printed versions here in mention&mdash;the one of 1856 or 1872, Hallock's of 1859,
and Brower's of 1893. They are all to the same effect, and evidently from one
source; but the textual discrepancies of all three are so great that they can
scarcely be called "copies." Brower speaks of "several letters written by Mr.
Morrison on this subject," and states that the one he prints, of Jan. 16th, 1856,
"is given in full, and just as written and signed." From this imprint I extract
the following clauses: "I left the old Grand Portage, July, 1802, ...
in 1803-4, I went and wintered at Lac La Folle.... Lac La Biche is near
to Lac La Folle. Lac La Biche is the source of the Great River Mississippi,
which I visited in 1804, and if the late Gen. Pike did not lay it down as such
when he came to Leech lake it is because he did not happen to meet me....
I visited in 1804, Elk lake, and again in 1811-12," etc. Nothing appears to invalidate
this letter; for Mr. Schoolcraft's contemptuous contention of 1859 belittled
Mr. Morrison and Mr. Hallock without disproving or even disputing Mr.
Morrison's claim. The gravamen of Mr. Schoolcraft's charge is contained in
the statement "that he [Morrison], or his friends in Minnesota, should have deferred
forty-seven years to make this important announcement, is remarkable."
It may have been "remarkable"; but it is not inexplicable. Mr. Henry D.
Harrower, in the Educational Reporter Extra, Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor and
Co., New York and Chicago, pub. Oct., 1886, 8vo, p. 17, has some discerning
and judicious remarks on this score: "The statements of the brothers Morrison
have generally been received without question by scientists and geographers
in Minnesota; and in his letter Allan Morrison expresses surprise that
anyone should be ignorant of the title of his brother to the discovery of Itasca
prior to Schoolcraft. It is a curious fact, however, that Allan Morrison acted
as guide for Charles Lanman for a number of weeks in 1846, during which
time they visited Itasca Lake; and that Lanman, in his published account of
the trip, nowhere mentions Wm. Morrison, or intimates that he was ever at the
source of the Mississippi, but definitely ascribes the discovery to Schoolcraft in
1832. See Lanman's 'Adventures in the Wilderness,' vol. i, pages 48, 75, etc.
I venture the opinion that Morrison first identified his Elk Lake of 1804 with
Schoolcraft's Itasca when he read Schoolcraft's 'Summary Narrative' (1855);
and that it is safe to say that if Morrison discovered Lake Itasca, Schoolcraft
discovered Morrison." This may be considered to raise the question, What
constitutes discovery? But that does not affect the main issue. Mr. Morrison's
declaration that he visited Lake Itasca in 1804 and again in 1811-12 thus
far rests uncontested. If the case is ever re-opened, it will probably be upon
newly discovered documentary evidence of priority of discovery by some
Frenchman. When Pike was at Leech l. he just missed, by some months and
scarcely more miles, the glory of the most important discovery he could possibly
have made in the course of this or his other expedition.</p>

<p class="footnote">In May, 1820, Lewis Cass, then governor of Michigan, left Detroit with 38
men, among whom was Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. Proceeding by Michilimackinac
he struck the Miss. r. at Sandy l., and entered it July 17th. The narrative
recites that he went to Peckagama falls, thence 55 m. to the Forks, 45 to Lake
Winnipec, and about 50 m. more to the large lake then first called Cassina and
afterward Cass l. by Schoolcraft. This was entered July 21st; but the party
went no further. It was then represented to them that the source of the river
was in a lake called La Beesh, <i>i. e.</i>, La Biche, erroneously supposed to be 60
miles N. W.; upon which the river was computed to be 3,038 m. long, at an
altitude of 1,330 feet: for the particulars of this voyage, see Schoolcraft's Narrative
Journal, etc., pub. E. and E. Hosford, Albany, N. Y., 1821, 1 vol. 8vo,
pp. i-xvi, 17-419, 4 unpaged pages of index, map, plates; it is full of errors.
The Cradled Hercules, as Nicollet later called it, slept on this till Schoolcraft
returned in 1832 to awaken the infant, with Lieut. Allen, Rev. Mr. Boutwell,
Dr. Houghton, and Mr. Johnston, under the leadership of Chief Ozawindib.</p>

<p class="footnote">Giacomo Constantino Beltrami was b. Bergamo, Italy, 1779; <i>au mieux</i>,
Mme. La Comtesse de Campagnoni <i>nÃ©e</i> Passeri, at Florence, 1812; exiled, 1821;
Fort St. Anthony (Snelling), May 10th, 1823; and when Long's expedition came
in July of that year, he accompanied it up the Minn. r. and down the Red
River of the North to Pembina, where he took offense and his congÃ© simultaneously,
between Aug. 5th-9th. The differences between the American soldier
and the expatriated Italian were great and various. Major Long ejected
Signor Beltrami on the spot, and on paper dismissed him not less curtly and
contemptuously, making this harsh judgment a personal matter over initials S.
H. L. in Keating, I., p. 314: "An Italian whom we met at Fort St. Anthony
attached himself to the expedition and accompanied us to Pembina. He has
recently published a book entitled, 'La DÃ©couverte des Sources du Mississippi,'
&amp;c., which we notice merely on account of the fictions and misrepresentations
it contains." Mr. Schoolcraft makes a point of snubbing Sig. Beltrami:
see <i>posteÃ </i>. The amiable M. le Professeur Nicollet alone has a kindly word for his
co-laborer in Mississippian exploration: "He descended Turtle river, which empties
into Lake Cass;&mdash;that had been the terminus of the expedition of 1820, under
the command of General Cass, and in honor of whom it is so named. Now, as the
sources of Turtle river are more distant from the mouth of the Mississippi than
this [Itasca] lake, Mr. Beltrami thought himself authorized to publish that <i>he</i>
had discovered the sources of the Mississippi. Hence, perhaps, may be explained
why, as late as Mr. Schoolcraft's expedition of 1832, the sources of the
river were laid down as N. W. of Lake Cass. I may be mistaken, but it strikes
me that American critics have been too disdainful of Mr. Beltrami's book,
which found many readers on both continents, whilst it propagated some painful
errors," Rep. 1843, p. 59. Hon. J. V. Brower, the latest and altogether the
best monographer, stigmatizes Sig. Beltrami as "a hero-worshipper with but one
hero, and that himself," Miss. R., etc., 1893, p. 136. With me the question
is not one of Beltrami's character, temperament, imagination, sex-relations, etc.,
but simply, What did he do about the Mississippian <i>origines</i>? Brower gives a
clear, connected, and fair answer, <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 137-141, in part from an article by
Mr. A. J. Hill of St. Paul. Beltrami bravely made his way alone to Red l.,
which he left Aug. 26th, 1823; was guided Aug. 28th to the vicinity of Turtle
l.; found a spot whence he thought water flowed four ways, N., S., E., W., to
three oceans, and which <i>was</i> a part of the divide between Mississippian and
Hudsonian waters; named Lake Julia, tributary to Turtle l., as a "Julian
source" of the Mississippi, which it <i>was</i>; declared it to be the true source, as
he defined the "source" of a river, by position relative to position of the mouth;
declared and certainly believed he had discovered this source, in which he was
mistaken, as it was already known; named other lakes for other friends; and was
informed by his guide of Lake Itasca, which he located on his map with approx.
accuracy by the name of Doe l., translating Lac La Biche of the F., though
it appears in his text as Bitch l. by mistake. For Beltrami distinctly speaks, II.
p. 434, of Lake Itasca: "which the Indians call Moscosaguaiguen, or Bitch
lake, which receives no tributary stream, and seems to draw its waters from the
bosom of the earth. <i>It is here in my opinion that we shall fix the western
sources of the Mississippi</i>," as Schoolcraft and Allen did, nine years afterward.
Beltrami proceeded to Cass l., and thence to Fort St. Anthony, where he arrived
after great hardships in a state of extreme destitution; went to New Orleans,
and there published his first book, 1824. In all this I see no necessary occasion
for disdain or derision; the man did the best he could&mdash;"angels could
do no more." He showed courage, fortitude, endurance, perseverance, ambition,
and enthusiasm&mdash;all admirable qualities. He wrote an extravagant book,
to be sure; but it displays less egotism and more fidelity to the facts, as he understood
them, than Hennepin's, for example, and has a higher moral quality than
the average Jesuit Relation. He shot high, but not with a longer bow than
many a traveler before and since himself. One test of his good faith is the perfect
ease with which we can find the facts in his book and separate them from
the figments of his overwrought imagination. Heredity and environment conspired
to lead him into grave errors of judgment and some misstatements of fact;
but which one of us who write books can stone <i>his</i> glass house with impunity?
Beltrami's Julian source will run in the books as long as the water runs from
that source, alongside the Plantagenian and Itascan sources. Beltrami's map
locates Doe=Itasca l. with greater accuracy than any earlier map does. The
"pointed similarity" it has been said to bear to Pike's&mdash;and I fear as a suggestion
of plagiarism&mdash;does not extend to the Itascan source, for there is not a trace
of this on Pike's published map. Beltrami went from New Orleans to Mexico,
traversed that country, reached London about 1827, published his Pilgrimage,
etc., 2 vols., and d. at Filotrano, Feb., 1855, in his 76th year. He fills the niche
in Mississippian geographical history between Cass, 1820, and Schoolcraft and
Allen, 1832; meanwhile, Itasca State Park lies mainly in Beltrami Co., Minn.,
which includes both the Julian and Itascan sources. There was nothing the
matter with Beltrami but woman on the brain; he had a queen bee in his
bonnet&mdash;that is all. Much that has been taken for puerile conceit is the virile
badinage of a man of the world, of wit, and of penetration. I have read his
Pilgrimage with interested attention; it is clear to me that Beltrami was no
mere <i>flÃ¢neur</i>&mdash;by no means such a trifler as some of his passages might excuse
one for supposing him to be. He was a well-read and well-traveled man;
his <i>obiter dicta</i> on various things, as religion, politics, society, and other broad
themes, are generally acute. He was a brave man; I imagine Major Long had
a time of it with Sioux, and Signor Beltrami too; it seems to have been a case of
scalping-knife and stiletto. As I have already cited the military mailed hand,
let us see the fine Italian hand: "Major Long did not cut a very noble figure
in the affair; I foresaw all the disgusts and vexations I should have to experience,"
II. p. 303; "met a band of Sioux. The major thought he read hostile
intentions in their faces; he even thought they had threatened him;&mdash;of course
everybody else thought so too&mdash;like Casti's courtiers; ... it was incumbent
on me, therefore, to be very much alarmed, too; ... I rather think the
fright they threw the major into was in revenge for his giving them nothing but
boring speeches. If they meant it so they had every reason to be satisfied,"
II. pp. 336-37; "Colonel Snelling's son, who shewed the most friendly concern
and apprehensions for me. He also left the major at the same time, not without
violent altercation, ... with considerable regret I parted from Dr. Say,
one of the naturalists attached to the expedition, the only one who deserved the
designation [this was a tickler for Prof. Keating's fifth rib]," II. 370; "they
[Colonel Snelling, Major Taliaferro, and others] were indignant against Major
Long for acting towards me in the miserable manner that he did. With respect
to myself, I feel towards him a sort of gratitude for having by his disgusting
manners only strengthened my determination to leave him," II. p. 483. Beltrami
was evidently able to keep his own scalp, and his book is vastly diverting,
except in the boggy places, where he mires us down with his gynÃ¦cosophy. It
is entitled: A Pilgrimage in Europe and America, leading to the Discovery of the
Sources of the Mississippi River, etc., 2 vols., 8vo, London, 1828, pp. i-lxxvi,
1-472, and 1-545, map and plates. It is dedicated "To the Fair Sex. Oh
Woman!" The text is in epistolary form, ostensibly addressed to the countess,
and consists of 22 letters, 1821-23; matter of Julian sources, II. p. 409 <i>seq.</i>,
and map.</p>

<p class="footnote">In 1830, Cass was directed by the War Department to request Schoolcraft,
who was then an agent of the Office of Indian affairs of the W. D., to proceed
into the Chippewa country to endeavor to put an end to the hostilities between
the Chippewas and the Sioux. The wars which neither Pike, nor Clark, nor anybody
else had succeeded in stopping permanently in those quarters were thus
indirectly the cause, and directly the occasion, of the rediscovery of the source of
the Miss. r. Schoolcraft left St. Mary's, at the foot of Lake Superior, late in
June, 1831, with 27 persons, exclusive of guides and Indian portagers. But the
atrocious massacre of Menomonees by the Sacs and Foxes at Prairie du Chien,
and other circumstances, diverted this expedition from the sources of the river,
and Schoolcraft returned to the Sault Ste. Marie. The plan was resumed early
in 1832, when another party was made up of some 30 persons, on the basis of
an attempt to effect permanent peace between the two principal tribes. Schoolcraft
left the Sault June 7th, 1832. This place was and is on a large lake
which S. calls Igomi, Chigomi, and Gitchigomi, and others Kitchi Gummi&mdash;though
we prefer Lake Superior to the Chippewa vernacular. On July 3d, he
reached Mr. Aitkin's trading-house on the discharge of Sandy l., a distance of
about 150 m. by the usual St. Louis and Savanna rivers route. Cass l. was
entered on the 10th; this was the point of departure for new exploration, as it
was that where the Cass expedition had ended July 21st, 1820. Cass l. was then
determined to be 2,978 instead of 3,038 m. from the Gulf of Mexico by the
course of the river. The Indian guide, Ozawindib, began to make history and
immortalize his name at this point. He took the party up the Miss. r. to Lac
Traverse or Pamitchi Gumaug, that is, to Lake Bemidji, and thence by the chain
of lakes Schoolcraft called Irving, Marquette, La Salle, and Plantagenet, up the
course of the "South" (better called East) fork of the Miss. r. to the Naiwa r.
and Usawa l., thus discovering the linked chain which later became known as
the "Plantagenian source": see <a href="#Footnote_III-8">note<sup>8</sup></a>, p. 162. Ozawindib then portaged the
party over to the lake which Morrison had discovered in 1804. Camp was
pitched on the island which by common consent bears Schoolcraft's name, July
13th, 1832. The party consisted of 16 persons, including Ozawindib, Mr.
Schoolcraft, Lieut. James Allen, U.Â S.Â A., Dr. Douglass Houghton, Rev. Wm.
T. Boutwell, and Mr. George Johnston. The name "Itasca" was a whim of
Schoolcraft's, which would mislead anyone who should search Indian languages
for its etymology, especially as Mr. S. himself affects obscurantism by saying:
"Having previously got an inkling of some of their mythological and necromantic
notions of the origin and mutations of the country, which permitted
the use of a female name for it, I denominated it Itasca." This is a dark hint
of mystic and very likely phallic superstitions; but the facts in the case are
given in Brower's Report, p. 148, from personal interview with the Rev. Boutwell
himself, who said in substance that once when he and Mr. S. were in the same
canoe in 1832, the latter suddenly turned and asked him what was the Greek
and Latin definition of the headwaters or true source of a river. Mr. B. could
not on the spur of the moment rally any Greek, but mustered Latin enough to
give Mr. S. his choice of <i>Verum Caput</i> (true head) or <i>Veritas</i>, <i>Caput</i> (truth,
head); by combining which latter two words, beheading one and bobtailing the
other, Mr. S. made (Ver)ITASCA(put), and said, "Itasca shall be the name."
He was quite equal to such juggling with words; <i>e. g.</i>, his Lake Shiba is named
by a word which consists of the initial letters of <i>s</i>choolcraft, <i>h</i>oughton, <i>i</i>ohnston
(for <i>j</i>ohnston), <i>b</i>outwell, and <i>a</i>llen. It is lucky Mr. Boutwell did not
think of the Greek for "head waters," or Itasca might have been named
Lake Hydrocephalus. Mr. Schoolcraft perpetuated the etymological myth
by perpetrating some stanzas, two lines of which are: "As if in Indian myths
a truth there could be read, And these were tears indeed, by fair Itasca shed."
None of the party appears to have noticed the smaller lake south of Itasca,
though it was only 333 yards from the head of the W. arm, which was not explored;
and in fact the visit of so much historical moment was in itself but
momentary. The main point ascertained was the <i>location</i> of Itasca to the S. W.
of Cass l., where Beltrami had already represented it to be, instead of the N. W.
where Schoolcraft had supposed it was. The many little lakes and streams in
the Itasca basin, and all nice topographic features, were left to be discovered by
Nicollet and his successors. Their Chippewa guide took them back by way
of the main, west, or Itascan course of the river to Cass l., whence they went
to Leech l., thence by the chain of lakes to Crow Wing r., and so on to the
Mississippi again. It is certainly not my desire to disparage Mr. Schoolcraft;
but one who could be taken to the source of the Mississippi and leave it the
same day, seeing nothing but what was shown him, and giving only a glance at
that, was not the person who should have snubbed Beltrami as he did when he
wrote that "a Mr. Beltrami, returning from the settlement of Pembina by the
usual route of the traders from Red Lake to Turtle Lake, published at New
Orleans, a small 12mo volume under the title of 'La dÃ©couverte des sources du
Mississippi, et de la Riviere [<i>sic</i>] Sanglante,' a work which has since been expanded
into two heavy 8vo volumes by the London press" (Narrative, etc.,
heavy 8vo, New York, 1834, p. 73). That sort of a sneer at a prior explorer
in the same region comes with particularly bad grace from a gentleman who
was expert in expanding his own stock of information to the most voluminous
proportions, and whose cacoÃ«thes scribendi, by dint of incessant scratching, finally
developed a case of pruritus senilis, marked by an acute mania for renaming
things he had named years before: see his Summary Narrative, etc., Philada.,
Lippincott, Grambo and Co., 1855. Mr. Schoolcraft never forgave Sig.
Beltrami for telling where Lake Itasca would be found; had he done so, he
would have been untrue to the supreme selfishness, inordinate vanity, vehement
prejudices, and conscientious narrow-mindedness with which his all-wise and
all-powerful Calvinistic Creator had been graciously pleased to endow him.
Another account of Schoolcraft's expedition of 1832 occupies pp. 125-132 of
Minn. Hist. Soc. Coll., I. 2d ed. 1872; Mr. Boutwell's narrative of the same
is found <i>ibid.</i>, pp. 153-176.</p>

<p class="footnote">James Allen's name is not so well known in this connection as it should be.
That is to say, the public seldom connects his name with the discovery of Lake
Itasca. But if Mr. Schoolcraft was the actual head of the expedition of 1832,
and became its best known historian, Lieutenant Allen was a large and shapely
portion of the body of that enterprise, decidedly the better observer, geographer,
and cartographer; item, the commander of the military escort, which might
have been necessary for safety and success; item, the author of an able,
interesting, and important report upon the subject, which he made to the
military authorities. He was detailed for this duty by order of A. Macomb,
Major-General, commanding the army, dated Hdqrs. of the Army, Washn., May
9th, 1832, and proceeded to Fort Brady, Mich., with a detachment consisting
of Corporal Wibru, and Privates Briscoe, Beemis, Burke, Copp, Dutton, Ingram,
Lentz, Riley, and Wade, of the 5th Infantry. He was gone June 6th-Aug.
26th, 1832. His movements were the same as Mr. Schoolcraft's, except where
the latter left him in the lurch on the St. Croix; his operations more extensive
and more intelligently directed to explore and report upon the country. He
named Schoolcraft isl. and various other things; Allen's bay was named for him
by Mr. Schoolcraft, and Allen's l. by Mr. Brower. Allen was an Ohio man,
appointed from Madison, Jefferson Co., Ind., cadet at West Point, July 1st,
1825; 2d lieut. 5th Infantry, July 1st, 1829; 2d lieut. 1st Dragoons, Mar. 4th,
1833; 1st lieut. May 31st, 1835; capt., June 30th, 1837; on detached service,
engineering duty, Chicago, 1837-38; d. suddenly at Fort Leavenworth, Kas.,
Aug. 22d or 23d, 1846, as lieutenant-colonel of a Mormon battalion of volunteer
infantry he had raised to re-enforce our Army of the West, "beloved while
living, and regretted after death, by all who knew him," Hughes, Doniphan's
Exped., 1847, p. 53. His valuable Mississippi report, completed at Fort Dearborn
(Chicago), Nov. 25th, 1833, was transmitted to Congr. by Hon. Lewis
Cass, Sec. of War, Apr. 11th, 1834, and published in Amer. State Papers,
Class V. Milit. Affairs, V. Ex. Doc. No. 579, 1st Session, 23d Congr., folio,
pp. 312-344, and map.</p>

<p class="footnote">The illustrious name of Jean Nicolas Nicollet is first in time on the roll
of those who have applied modern methods of exact and exacting science to the
geography of the West. Nicollet is most highly appreciated by those who are
themselves most worthy of appreciation and most competent critics. Thus,
Gen. G. K. Warren pronounces Nicollet's map "one of the greatest contributions
ever made to American geography." It will stand forever as the sound basis
of knowledge on the subject. Notices of Nicollet's life and work are found in:

d. Baltimore, Md., Sept. 11th, 1843. He was a watchmaker's apprentice
till Ã¦t. 18; was a natural musician; studied languages and mathematics, and in
1818 published an article which became noted in the annals of insurance for its
calculations on probable duration of human life; he wrote others of similar
character; 1819 to 1828, he published various mathematical and astronomical
treatises; was decorated in 1825 with the Cross of the Legion of Honor; at one
time held a professorship in the Royal College of Louis Le Grand; was also an
inspector of naval schools; he was in high esteem, and made money. But the
fickle goddess of fortune ceased to smile; he made business ventures which
failed, and cost him all his worldly goods and all his fair-weather friends; in
1832 he was a poor refugee in the United States. But his amiable character,
his accomplishments, his great talents, and greater genius were more conspicuous
in adversity than they had been in prosperity. He made friends everywhere,
among them some in high stations, able to estimate his abilities and
glad to use his services. Under the auspices of the War Department, and
with the personal attentions of such men as Pierre Chouteau, Jr., Gen. Sibley,
and Maj. Taliaferro, he was enabled to make, 1833-39, those several explorations
and surveys which resulted in his Map and Report&mdash;a work which would
have done credit to anyone under any circumstances, but one which only a
Nicollet could have accomplished under the actual conditions. In 1840 and
1841 he was on office duty in Washington, reducing his field-work and preparing
his map, which latter was drawn under his direction by Lieuts. J. C.
FrÃ©mont and E. P. Scammon. This was completed probably in 1840, as it
had been submitted to Congress and ordered to be printed, Feb. 16th, 1841.
But the hardships he had endured in the field had undermined his frail physique;
the further drafts upon his balance of vitality were overdrawn; and the
fatal blow was given by Arago, who defeated his election to the French
Academy. "Pas mÃªme un Academicien," this great soul never wore the
crown of his life. His work was published under the editorship of Gen. J. J.
Abert, to whom science is indebted in many ways&mdash;perhaps in no one of these
more than in the recognition of the merits of the gentle Savoyard, and consequently
the steps he took to facilitate and complete Nicollet's labors. The

and Rives, 1843, pp. 1-170, map, 30Â¾ Ã 37 inches; also pub. as Ex. Doc. No.
52, Ho. Reps., 2d Sess., 28th Congr. The report is officially addressed to
Colonel Abert; the original journals and other MSS. were to be deposited in
the Bureau of the Corps of Topographical Engineers, Sept. 13th, 1843. I have
examined the original map, from which the published one was engraved, not
without some variant lettering here and there; it is now in bad condition, very
brittle, and would soon go to pieces if often unrolled without great care in
handling it. I think it should be renovated, without delay, and put in the
best possible condition for permanent preservation.</p>

<p class="footnote">July 26th, 1836, Nicollet went from Fort Snelling to the Falls of St. Anthony,
with Lieutenants S. N. Plummer, G. W. Shaw, and James McClure, to see him
off; 29th, he was ascending the river; at the mouth of the Crow Wing he left
the Mississippi, ascended the former to Gayashk or Gull r., went from this to
Pine r., visited Kadikomeg or Whitefish l. thence up E. fork of Pine r. to Kwiwisens
or Boy r., and down this into Leech l., where he spent a week, mostly
camped on Otter Tail pt., where resided his principal guide, Francis Brunet&mdash;"a
man six feet three inches high&mdash;a giant of great strength, but at the same
time full of the milk of human kindness and, withal, an excellent natural
geographer." He found here Mr. Boutwell, who was good enough to help him
out of some sort of a scrape the Chippewas got him into. He left Leech l. in
a bark canoe with Brunet, another man named DesirÃ©, and a Chippewa whose
name he renders Kegwedzissag, since spelled Gaygwedosay and applied to a
creek which runs into present Elk l. He crossed several small lakes and came
to one he calls Kabe-Konang&mdash;not the same as Schoolcraft's Kubba Kunna,
which latter is the one S. called Lake Plantagenet, and is on Nicollet's Laplace r.
He continued up Kabekonang r., made a 5-m. portage to Laplace r. (which
is also called Naiwa, Yellow Head, and Schoolcraft's r., being the Plantagenet
fork of the Miss. r.), and ascended it to a position 1 m. south of Assawa l.,
where he found the traces of a camp used four years before by the Schoolcraft
party. Next morning he was up at 4.30, preparing for the 6-m. portage to
Lake Itasca across the Big Burning&mdash;by no means an easy thing; the ground
was very bad, and the mosquitoes as bad as they knew how to be. Brunet carried
the canoe, weighing 110-115 lbs.; DesirÃ© and Kegwedzissag had each a load of
85-90 lbs.; while poor Nicollet had a full burden in proportion to the powers
of the slight and frail body that was so soon, alas! to fail him altogether. "I
had about 35 pounds' weight unequally distributed upon my body.... I carried
my sextant on my back in a leather case thrown over me as a knapsack; then
my barometer slung over my left shoulder; my cloak thrown over the same
shoulder confined the barometer closely against the sextant; a portfolio under
the arm; a basket in hand which contained my thermometer, chronometer,
pocket compass, artificial horizon, tape-line, &amp;c. On the right side, a spy-glass,
powder-flask, and shot-bag; and in my hand a gun or an umbrella according
to circumstances. Such was my accoutrement." Though Nicollet estimated
his load at only 35 pounds, it was an awkward one to manage, and more
than he should have undertaken to carry through such a place; his head swam
more than once, he lost his way, got bogged several times, and only extricated
himself by scrambling along slippery and decayed tree-trunks. However, he
reached Itasca safely, two hours after the rest, pitched his tent on the island,
and proceeded to adjust his artificial horizon. During the three days spent in
exploring the basin he made those minute and precise observations which will
forever associate his honored name with Mississippian discovery. His approach
to the spot duplicated Mr. Schoolcraft's; but the comparison need not be
pushed further&mdash;it cannot be. Nicollet's return was by way of the main stream
to Lake Cass and thence to Leech l.&mdash;where, by the way, he had a conference
with that sagacious savage Eshkibogikoj, otherwise Gueule Platte or Flat Mouth,
with whom he took tea "out of fine china-ware" and spent evenings "full of
instruction." Of the fine work he did at Lake Itasca, I must quote his own
modest words: "The honor of having first explored the sources of the Mississippi
and introduced a knowledge of them in physical geography, belongs to Mr.
Schoolcraft and Lieutenant Allen. I come only after these gentleman; but I
may be permitted to claim some merit for having completed what was wanting
for a full geographical account of these sources. Moreover, I am, I believe, the
first traveler who has carried with him astronomical instruments, and put them
to profitable account along the whole course of the Mississippi, from its mouth
to its sources." He might well have claimed more than this; for, aside from all
topographic and hydrographic details, what he discovered, determined, and
described was the Mississippi itself above Lake Itasca. His praise is greatest
in the mouths of wisest censure, and for once in the history of discovery no
one withholds from modest merit and signal achievement their just dues.</p>

<p class="footnote">The length of this note warns me to resist the temptation to pursue post-Nicolletian
exploration and touring&mdash;through the names of Charles Lanman,
1846; Rev. Frederick Ayer and son, 1849; Wm. Bungo, 1865; Julius Chambers,
of the New York Herald's "Dolly Varden" expedition, 1872; James H. Baker,
in official capacities, 1875-79; Edwin S. Hall, U.Â S. surveyor, 1875; A. H. Siegfried,
representing the Louisville Courier-Journal's "Rob Roy" expedition,
1879; O. E. Garrison, 1880; W. E. Neal, 1880 and 1881; Rev. J. A. Gilfillan
and Prof. Cooke, in May, 1881, the same year that one X. Y. Z. exploited his
fraud&mdash;to that of J. V. Brower, 1888-94. The scandalous episode in a record
otherwise honorable to all concerned may be read in all its unsavory particulars
in the able exposÃ©s made by Mr. H. D. Harrower, entitled: Captain Glazier
and his Lake, etc., pub. Ivison, Blakeman, Taylor and Co., N. Y., Oct., 1886,
pp. 1-58, with 9 maps; by Mr. Hopewell Clarke, in Science and Education, I.

the report entitled: The Sources of the Mississippi. Their Discoveries, real
and pretended, read before the Minn. His. Soc., Feb. 8th, 1887, and published
as Vol. VI., Pt. I, of that society's Collections, pp. 28; and by Commissioner
Brower, pp. 191-209 of his elaborate and exhaustive monograph, pub.
1893, to which I am greatly indebted, and to which reference should be made
for further details, whether in the history or the geography of the Mississippian
sources. Nicollet is the pivotal point upon which the whole matter turns from
Morrison to Brower, 1804-1894.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIII-1" id="Footnote_VIII-1" href="#FNanchor_VIII-1"><span class="label">[VIII-1]</span></a> As explained in <a href="#Footnote_VII-1">note<sup>1</sup></a>, p. 287, this chapter is that part of Doc. No. 18
which relates to the Indians, running pp. 56-66 and folder, without break in the
text of p. 56 from the geographical matter. But its separation seems desirable,
and I accordingly make a chapter for its accommodation. There is no

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIII-2" id="Footnote_VIII-2" href="#FNanchor_VIII-2"><span class="label">[VIII-2]</span></a> The Sacs and Foxes have a curious history, perhaps not exactly paralleled
by that of any other tribes whatever. The names are linked inseparably
from the earliest times to the present day. Each has always been to the
other what neither of them has ever been to any other Indians or to any whites&mdash;friend.
The entire composure with which we have been able to speak of Sacs
and Foxes in our day and generation is the reverse of the frame of mind which
many persons now living can recall as having been once theirs, before the final
subjugation of these capricious, turbulent, and enterprising tribes in trans-Mississippian
territory. They are Algonquian Indians who can be traced in blood
from Lake Ontario westward, along the gauntlet they ran from Ontarian Canada
to the final burying-grounds of their hatchets in Iowa, Kansas, and the
Indian Territory. They fought everybody in their way&mdash;French, English, and
American in turn, as well as perhaps every Indian tribe they encountered. They
were alternately friends and foes of each of the two principal nations whose lands
they overran&mdash;their Algonquian relations the Chippewas, and their natural enemies
the Sioux, thus at times turning the balance of power between these two
hereditary foes. They inhabited at times many places along the Great Lakes
and westward, and the present names of not a few are directly traceable to such
occupancy. They were specially identified with the histories of Wisconsin, Minnesota,
and Illinois for more than a hundred years. Carver speaks of their villages
on the Wisconsin r. in 1766, after they had been expelled from the Green
Bay and Fox River region. They appear to have been driven from the St. Croix
by the decisive battle at the Falls, in which they were defeated by the Chippewas
under Waboji (d. 1793). Writing of 1832, Schoolcraft speaks of their
recent residences on Rock r., and their confinement west of the Mississippi
by the then latest tragic act in their history. This was the decisive battle of
the Bad Axe in 1832: see <a href="#Footnote_I-51">note<sup>51</sup></a>, p. 45. The Foxes are located on the old
maps under some form of their Chippewan name Otagami; they were also
called Miskwakis or Red Earths; their F. name Reynard, which we translate
Fox, and sometimes Dog or Wolf, was an opprobrious nickname or nom de
guerre. The Indian name Osagi, Osawki, Osaukee, Sauk, Sac, Sacque, etc., is
by some said to signify the erratic propensities of the tribe which bears it, meaning
migrants, or those who went out of the land: for a probably better definition,
see <a href="#Footnote_II-16">note<sup>16</sup></a>, p. 101. The survivors of both tribes scarcely number 1,000.</p>

<p class="footnote">Le Bras CassÃ©, or Broken Arm, was a Sac chief whom Pike names Pockquinike
in his folding <a href="#abstract">Table</a> of the Foxes and other Indians. He was a noted
character, whose name turns up in various published accounts. He figures, for
example, in the Relation, etc., of Perreault, on the scene of the assassination of
Mr. Kay at Sandy Lake, May 2d, 1785, by Le Cousin and his mother, both of
whom knifed their victim. Le Cousin was promptly stabbed by Feebyain or
Le Petit Mort, a friend of Kay's, and Brasse Casse (as Mr. Schoolcraft spells
his name) took Kay in hand to cure him; but the wound proved fatal Aug.
26th, 1785.</p>

<p class="footnote">For the modern scientific classification of the Siouan linguistic family in general,
and of the Dakotas or Sioux in particular, see my ed. of Lewis and Clark,
1893, pp. 94-101, and pp. 128-130. As that work is or should be in the hands
of all good Americans, the subject need not be traversed here. Taking that
article as a modern norm or standard of comparison, it may be useful to give
here the classification and nomenclature of the Sioux which was adopted by
Major Long, who was next in the field after Pike with an account of these Indians,
Keating, I. 1824, chap. viii., p. 376 <i>seq.</i> The Dacota, he says, means
the allied, who in their external relations style themselves Ochente Shakoan,
which signifies the nation of seven (council-) fires, represented by the following
septenary division which once prevailed: 1. <i>Mende Wahkantoan</i>, or People of
the Spirit lake. 2. <i>Wahkpatoan</i>, or People of the Leaves. 3. <i>Sisitoan</i>, or
Mia Kechakesa. 4. <i>Yanktoanan</i>, or People of the Ferns. 5. <i>Yanktoan</i>, or
People descended from Ferns. 6. <i>Titoan</i> , or Braggers. 7. <i>Wahkpakotoan</i>, or
People that shoot at Leaves. Of these Long has it that No. 1 was the Gens du
Lac of the French, and Nos. 2-6 were all included in the Gens du Large of the
F. traders, <i>i. e.</i>, People "at large," roving bands of prairie Sioux. But the
French had other terms, especially Gens des Feuilles for No. 2, and Gens des
Feuilles TirÃ©es for No. 7. Comparing Long with Pike, we find: Long's No.
1=Pike's No. 1. Long's No. 2=Pike's No. 2. Long's No. 3=Pike's No. 3.
Long's Nos. 4 and 5=Pike's No. 4, with his two divisions. Long's No. 6=Pike's
No. 5. Long's No. 7=Pike's No. 6. Such a concordance as this deserves
a red-letter mark, considering how seldom authors have agreed upon
Sioux; and Pike is entitled to the credit of establishing the seven main tribes.
In his census, to be compared with Pike's, Long gives total lodges, 2,330; warriors,
7,055; souls, 28,100: see <a href="#abstract">Pike's Abstract</a>, on pp. 346, 347. These are
distributed by Long as follows: No. 1, 160&mdash;305&mdash;1,500. No. 2, 120&mdash;240&mdash;900.
No. 3, 130&mdash;260&mdash;1,000; to which add for the Kahra (Pike's Cawree)
band of Sissetons, 160&mdash;450&mdash;1,500. No. 4, 460&mdash;1,300&mdash;5,200. No. 5, 200&mdash;500&mdash;2,000.
No. 6, 900&mdash;3,600&mdash;14,440. No. 7, 100&mdash;200&mdash;800. To which
add for various stragglers 100&mdash;200&mdash;800, making total of lodges, warriors, and
souls, as above. Long estimated the revolted Stone Sioux, Haha, or Assiniboines
at 3,000&mdash;7,000&mdash;28,100, or almost precisely the same as all the other
Sioux together. Long's interesting particulars of the 14 bands which he recognizes,
by dividing his No. 1 into seven and separating the Kahras from the other
Sissetons, may be thus summarized: No. 1. <i>Mende-Wahkantoan</i>: (1) Keoxa;
pop. 40&mdash;70&mdash;400; chief Wapasha, Wabasha, La Feuille or Leaf; two villages,
one on Iowa r., other near Lake Pepin; hunt both sides of the Miss. r. near
the Chippewa r. and its tributaries. Keoxa means "relationship overlooked";
<i>i. e.</i>, they inbreed closer than other Sioux. (2) Eanbosandata, so called from
the vertical rock on Cannon r.; pop. 10&mdash;25&mdash;100; chief Shakea; two small
villages, one on the Miss. r., other on Cannon r.; hunt on the headwaters of
the latter. (3) Kapoja, signifying light or active; one village (at the Grand
Marais or Pig's Eye marsh near St. Paul); pop. 30&mdash;70&mdash;300; chief, the celebrated
Chetanwakoamene, Petit Corbeau, or little Raven, who visited Washington
in July, 1824; hunt on St. Croix r. (4) Oanoska, meaning great avenue;
chief Wamendetanka or War Eagle, formerly dependent on Petit Corbeau; one
village (Black Dog's) on the St. Peter, S. side, near the mouth; pop. 30&mdash;40&mdash;200;
hunt on the Miss. r. above Falls of St. Anthony. (5) Tetankatane,
meaning Old Village; the oldest one among the Dakotas; 400 lodges there
when Wapasha's father ruled the nation; Wapasha formerly lived there, but
moved away with most of his warriors; those that stayed chose a new leader
from amongst themselves, whose son Takopepeshene, the Dauntless, now rules;
pop. 10&mdash;30&mdash;150; village on the St. Peter, 3 m. above its mouth; hunt on
this and Miss. r. (6) Taoapa; one village on the St. Peter; pop. 30&mdash;60&mdash;300;
chief Shakpa, whose name means Six, is third in the nation, ranking next
after La Feuille and Petit Corbeau; hunt between the Miss. and St. Peter. (7)
Weakaote, a small band dependent on (6); pop. 10&mdash;10&mdash;50. No. 2. <i>Wahkpatoan</i>,
or Gens des Feuilles; name said to mean "people that live beyond
those that shoot at leaves," <i>i. e.</i>, higher up the river than the Wahkpakatoan;
hunt near Otter Tail Lake; chief Nunpakea, meaning "twice flying." No. 3.
<i>Miakechesa</i> or Sisitoan: (<i>a</i>) Sissetons proper; no fixed abode; chief rendezvous,
Blue Earth r.; hunt buffalo over to the Missouri; live in skin tepees;
their chief Wahkanto, or Blue Spirit, by hereditary right. (<i>b</i>) Kahra or Wild
Rice Sissetons; no fixed abode; Lake Traverse and Red r.; skin lodges; follow
chief Tantankanaje, Standing Buffalo, hereditary, but also a warrior. No.
4. <i>Yanktoanan</i>, the Fern Leaves, an important tribe, pop. one-fifth of the
whole nation; no fixed residence; skin lodges; hunt from Red r. to the Missouri;
trade at Lake Travers, Big Stone l., and the Shienne r.; principal chief,
Wanotan, the Charger. No. 5. <i>Yanktoan</i>, descended from the Fern Leaves;
live and trade on the Missouri; hunt on E. side of that river; chief Tatanka
Yuteshane, meaning one who eats no buffalo. No. 6. Tetoans, Braggers; by
far the most numerous tribe of the Sioux, by some said to compose one-half
of the nation; rove between St. Peters and the Missouri; trade on both rivers;
live in skin lodges; hostile, great boasters; their chief Chantapeta, or Heart of
Fire, a powerful warrior. No. 7. <i>Wahkpakotoan</i>, a name rendered by Long
"'Shooters at Leaves,' which they mistake for deer." No fixed abode; rove
near head of the Cannon and Blue Earth rivers; skin lodges; their last leader
Shakeska, White Nails, who died in 1822; he rose to his station by his military
ability. They have a regular hereditary chief Wiahuga, the Raven,
acknowledged as such by the Indian Agent; but he became disgusted with the
behavior of his tribe, and withdrew to Wapasha's. Long agrees with Pike in
giving this band a bad name as a lawless set. Pike says they were mere vagabonds,
and refugees from other tribes on account of misdeeds. These Sioux
were also called Gens des Feuilles TirÃ©es and Leaf Shooters. In the Lewis and
Clark schedule they formed the Ninth tribe of Sioux, named Wahpatoota, or
Leaf Beds. A queer form of the name is 8apik8ti=Ouapikouti, on one of
Joliet's maps.</p>

<p class="footnote">The earliest form of the word <i>Sioux</i> is believed to be Naduesiu, derived from
Jean Nicolet's journey of 1634-35, as written about five years later in the
Jesuit Relations, by Father Le Jeune. The form Nadouessis, pl., is used by
Raymbault and Jogues, who were at the Sault Ste. Marie in 1641 (Jes. Rel. of
1642). Nadouesiouek is given in a Relation of 1656, Nadouechiouec, 1660;
and soon also Nadouesseronons, Nadouesserons, etc.</p>

<p class="footnote">An excellent article on the Sioux, entitled Dakota Land and Dakota Life, by
Rev. E. D. Neill, occupies pp. 254-294 of the 2d ed. 1872, of Minn. Hist. Soc.
Coll., originally published in 1853.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_VIII-4" id="Footnote_VIII-4" href="#FNanchor_VIII-4"><span class="label">[VIII-4]</span></a> The punctuation of the last two sentences in the original left Pike's meaning
obscure. It was by no means evident whether the language which he had used
to the Indians held up to their minds a happy coincidence of circumstances
which the traders helped to bring about before the Almighty interfered at all, or
whether the happy coincidence of circumstances consisted in the endorsement of
his language both by the traders and the Almighty. On the whole, I am inclined
to think he meant that the speeches he made to the Indians whom he addressed
directly were repeated and backed up by the traders among those Indians to
whom he had no access; and that this was the happy coincidence of circumstances
which enabled the Almighty to finish the business. But after all I am
not quite confident that I catch his meaning. If I do, I must say that he is not
very complimentary to the Deity, whose assistance he suspects may have been
necessary to effect that which the traders and himself jointly attempted. For it
seems from his further reflections on the subject that he thought God possibly
equal to burying the hatchet between the Sioux and Chippewas, but hardly able
to keep the peace without the assistance of the military and of a special agent.
However, Pike was nothing if not a good soldier, and he had Napoleonic
authority for supposing that God would always be found on the side of the
heaviest artillery.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a name="Footnote_IX-1" id="Footnote_IX-1" href="#FNanchor_IX-1"><span class="label">[IX-1]</span></a> This article formed Doc. No. 2, pp. 52, 53 of the App. to <i>Part III.</i> of the orig.
ed., entitled "Explanatory Table of Names of Places, Persons, and Things,
made use of in this Volume." But there is not a name of any person in it, and
not a name of anything in it that does not belong to Part I., <i>i. e.</i>, to the Mississippi
voyage alone. Having thus been obviously out of place in Part III., it
is now brought where it belongs, and a new chapter made for it, with a new
head, which more accurately indicates what it is. But even as a vocabulary of
Mississippian place-names, it is a mere fragment, neither the plan nor scope of
which is evident, as the names occur neither in alphabetical nor any other
recognizable order, and include only a very small fraction of those which Pike
uses in Part I. of his book. He may have intended to make something of it
which should justify the title he gave it, and left it out of Part I. for that
reason; but nothing more came of it, and it was finally bundled into Part III.
The lists include a few terms which do not occur elsewhere in the work, as for
example, "River of Means"; but are chiefly curious as an evidence of the
difficulty our author found in spelling proper names twice alike.</p>
